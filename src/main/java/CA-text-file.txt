Preface
Distributed systems have witnessed phenomenal growth in the past few years.
The declining cost of hardware, the advancements in communication technology,
the explosive growth of the Internet, and our ever-increasing dependence on networks for
a wide range of applications ranging from social communication to financial transactions
have contributed to this growth. The breakthroughs in embedded systems, nanotechnology,
and wireless communication have opened up new frontiers of applications like sensor
networks and wearable computers. The rapid growth of cloud computing and the growing
importance of big data have changed the landscape of distributed computing.
Most applications in distributed computing center around a set of core subproblems.
A proper understanding of these subproblems requires a background of the underlying
theory and algorithmic issues. This book provides a balanced coverage of the foundational
topics and their relationship to real-world applications. The language has been kept
as unobfuscated as possible—clarity has been given priority over formalism. The second
edition fixes many of the problems in the first edition, adds new topics, and significantly
upgrades the contents. The 21 chapters have been divided into five sections: Section I
(Chapters 1 and 2) deals with background materials that include various cloud computing
platforms. Section II (Chapters 3 through 6) presents foundational topics, which
address system models,
correctness
criteria, and proof techniques. Section III (Chapters 7
through 11) presents
the core paradigms in distributed systems—these include logical
clocks, distributed snapshots and debugging, deadlock and termination detection, election,
and distributed graph algorithms. Section IV (Chapters 12 through 17) addresses
failures and fault-tolerance techniques in various applications—it covers consensus, transactions,
group communication, replicated data management, and self-stabilization. Group
communication and consensus have been included in this section since they are two of
the primary beneficiaries of fault-tolerant designs. Finally, Section V (Chapters 18 through
21) addresses a few real-world issues—these include distributed discrete-event simulation,
security, sensor networks, and social and peer-to-peer networks. Each chapter has a list
of exercises that will challenge the readers (those tagged with * are the more challenging
ones). A small number of these are programming exercises. Some exercises will encourage
the readers to learn about outside materials.
The book is intended for use in a one-semester course at the senior undergraduate
or the first-year graduate level. About 75% of the material can be covered in one semester.
Accordingly, the chapters can be picked and packaged in several different ways.
xxvi ◾ Preface
A theory-oriented offering is possible using Chapters 1 through 17. For a more practical
flavor, use Chapters 1 and 2, selected topics from Chapters 3 through 16, and Chapters 18
through 21, supplemented by a semester-long project chosen from replicated data management,
sensor networks, group communication, discrete-event simulation, and social
or peer-to-peer networks. Additional material is available from the author’s website:
http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~ghosh/thebook.html.
Here is a disclaimer: this book is not about programming distributed systems. Chapter 2
is only a high-level description that we expect everyone to know, but it is not an introduction
to programming. If programming is the goal, then I encourage readers to look for
other resources. There are several good books available on this topic.

Introduction
1.1 WHAT IS A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM?
Life in the twenty-first century has a growing dependence on networked services that have
changed the fabric of the society. Starting from web searching, video conferencing, stock
trading, and net banking to keeping in touch with friends and peers through various kinds
of social networks, network-based services play a dominant role. While networks provide
the basic connectivity, the various services built on top of these networks are examples of
distributed systems.
Leslie Lamport once noted, “A distributed system is one in which the failure of a
computer
you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.” While this
is certainly not a definition, it characterizes the challenges in coming up with an appropriate
definition of a distributed system. What is distributed in a distributed system? If
the processor of computer system is located 100 yards away from its main memory, then
is it a distributed system? What if the input–output devices are located 3 miles away from
the processor? If physical distribution is taken into account, then the definition of a distributed
system becomes uncomfortably dependent on the degree of physical distribution
of the hardware components, which is certainly not acceptable. To alleviate this problem,
it is customary to characterize a distributed system using the logical or functional distribution
of the processing capabilities.
A distributed system typically satisfies the following criteria:
Multiple processes: The system consists of more than one sequential process. These processes
can be either system or user processes, but each process should have an independent
thread of control—either explicit or implicit.
Interprocess communication: Processes communicate with one another using messages that
take a finite time to travel from one process to another. The actual nature or order of the
delay will depend on the physical characteristics of the message links. These message links
are also called channels.
Disjoint address spaces: Processes have disjoint address spaces. We will thus not take
into account a shared-memory multiprocessor as a true representation of a distributed
4 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
computing system. Note that programmers often represent interprocess communication
using shared-memory primitives, but the abstraction of shared memory can be implemented
using messages. The relationship between shared memory and message passing
will be discussed in Chapter 3.
Collective goal: Processes must interact with one another to meet a common goal. Consider
two processes P and Q in a network of processes. If P computes f(x) = x2 for a given set of
values of x, and Q multiplies a set of numbers by π, then we hesitate to call (P, Q) a distributed
system, since there is no interaction between P and Q. However, if P and Q cooperate
with one another to compute the areas of a set of circles of radius x, then (P, Q) collectively
represent a meaningful distributed system. Similarly, if a set of sellers advertise the cost of
their products, and a set of buyers post the list of the goods that they are interested in buying
as well as the prices they are willing to pay, then individually, neither the buyers nor
the sellers are meaningful distributed systems, but when they are coupled into an auction
system through the Internet, then it becomes a meaningful distributed system.
The aforementioned definition is a minimal one. It does not take into consideration the
system-wide executive control for interprocess cooperation or security issues, which are
certainly important concerns in the run-time management and support of user computations.
The definition highlights the simplest possible characteristics for a computation to
be logically distributed. Physical distribution is often a prerequisite for logical distribution.
1.2 WHY DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
Over the past years, distributed systems have gained substantial importance. The reasons
of their growing importance are manifold:
Geographically distributed environment: First, in many situations, the computing environment
itself is geographically distributed. As an example, consider a banking network. Each bank is
supposed to maintain the accounts of its customers. In addition, banks communicate with one
another to monitor interbank transactions or record fund transfers from geographically dispersed
automated teller machines (ATMs). Another common example of a geographically
distributed computing environment is the Internet, which has deeply influenced our way of
life. The mobility of the users has added a new dimension to the geographic distribution.
Speed up: Second, there is the need for speeding up computation. The speed of computation in
traditional uniprocessors is fast approaching the physical limit. While multicore, superscalar,
and very large instruction word (VLIW) processors stretch the limit by introducing parallelism
at the architectural level, the techniques do not scale well beyond a certain level. An alternative
technique of deriving more computational power is to use multiple processors. Dividing a
total problem into smaller subproblems and assigning these subproblems to separate physical
processors that can operate concurrently are potentially an attractive method of enhancing the
speed of computation. Moreover, this approach promotes better scalability, where the users or
administrators can incrementally increase the computational power by purchasing additional
processing elements or resources. This concept is extensively used by the social networking sites
for the concurrent upload and download of the photos and videos of millions of customers.
Introduction ◾ 5
Resource sharing: Third, there is a need for resource sharing. Here, the term resource
represents both hardware and software resources. The user of computer A may want to
use a fancy laser printer connected with computer B, or the user of computer B may need
some extra disk space available with computer C for storing a large file. In a network of
workstations, workstation A may want to use the idle computing powers of workstations
B and C to enhance the speed of a particular computation. Through Google Docs, Google
lets you share their software for word processing, spreadsheet application, and presentation
creation without anything else on your machine. Cloud computing essentially outsources
the computing infrastructure of a user or an organization to data centers—these centers
allow thousands of their clients to share their computing resources through the Internet
for efficient computing at an affordable cost.
Fault tolerance: Fourth, powerful uniprocessors or computing systems built around a single
central node are prone to a complete collapse when the processor fails. Many users consider
this to be risky. Distributed systems have the potential to remedy this by using appropriate faulttolerance
techniques—when a fraction of the processors fail, the remaining processes take over
the tasks of the failed processors and keep the application running. For example, in a system
having triple modular redundancy (TMR), three identical functional units are used to perform
the same computation, and the correct result is determined by a majority vote. In many faulttolerant
distributed systems, processors routinely check one another at predefined intervals,
allowing for automatic failure detection, diagnosis, and eventual recovery. Some users of noncritical
applications are willing to compromise with a partial degradation in system performance
when a failure cripples a fraction of the processing elements or the communication links
of a distributed system. This is the essence of graceful degradation. A distributed system thus
provides an excellent opportunity for incorporating fault tolerance and graceful degradation.
1.3 EXAMPLES OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
There are numerous examples of distributed systems that are used in everyday life in a
variety of applications. A fraction of these services are data intensive, and the computational
component is very small. Examples are database-oriented applications (think about Google
searching and collecting information from computers all over the world). Others are computation
intensive. Most systems are structured as client–server systems, where the server
machine is the custodian of data or resources and provides service to a number of geographically
distributed clients. A few applications, however, do not rely on a central server—these
are peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Here are a few examples of distributed systems:
World Wide Web: The World Wide Web (WWW) is a popular service running on the
Internet. It allows documents in one computer to refer to textual or nontextual information
stored in other computers. For example, a document in the United States may contain
references to the photograph of a rainforest in Africa or a music recording in Australia.
Such references are highlighted on the user’s monitor, and when selected by the user, the
system fetches the item from a remote server using appropriate protocols and displays the
picture or plays the music on the client machine.
6 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The Internet and the WWW have changed the way we perform our daily activities or
carry out business. For example, a large fraction of airline and hotel reservations are now
done through the Internet. Shopping through the Internet has dramatically increased during
the past few years. Millions of people now routinely trade stocks through the Internet.
Music lovers download and exchange CD-quality music, pushing old-fashioned CD and
DVD purchases to near obsolescence. Digital libraries provide users instant access to
archival information from the comfort of their homes.
Social networks: Internet-mediated social interaction has witnessed a dramatic growth in
recent times. Millions of users now use their desktop or laptop computers or smartphones
to post and exchange messages, photos, and video clips with their buddies using these
networking sites. Members of social networks can socialize by reading the profile pages
of other members and contacting them. Interactions among members often lead to the
formation of virtual communities or clubs sharing common interests. The inputs from
the members are handled by thousands of servers at one or more geographic locations, and
these servers carry out specific tasks on behalf of the members—some deal with photos,
some handle videos, some handle membership changes, etc. As membership grows, more
servers are added to the pool, and powerful servers replace the slower ones.
Interbank networks: Amy needs $300 on a Sunday morning, so she walks to a nearby ATM
to withdraw some cash. Amy has a checking account in Iowa City, but she has two savings
accounts—one in Chicago and the other in Denver. Each bank has set an upper limit of
$100 on the daily cash withdrawal, so Amy uses three different bank cards to withdraw the
desired cash. These debits are immediately registered in her bank accounts in three different
cities, and her new balances are recomputed. The ATMs are registered with their respective
financial institutions, and the interbank network carries out the entire operation.
Peer-to-peer networks: P2P systems are quite popular for file sharing, content distribution,
and Internet telephony. Historically, Napster was the pioneer in the use of P2P technology for
sharing the personal music collections of its clients. Instead of storing the songs on a central
computer, the songs live on users’ machines. There are millions of them scattered all over
the world. When you want to download a song using Napster, you are downloading it from
another person’s machine, and that person could be your next-door neighbor or someone
halfway around the world. This led to the development of P2P data sharing. Napster was
not a true P2P system, since it used a centralized directory. But many subsequent systems
providing similar service (e.g., Gnutella, KaZaA) avoided the use of a central server or a central
directory. P2P systems are now finding applications in areas beyond exchanging music
files. For example, the OceanStore project at the University of California, Berkeley, built an
online data archiving mechanism on top of an underlying P2P network Tapestry. Millions
use Skype that is built around P2P technology for Internet telephony and video chats.
Real-time distributed systems: Real-time distributed systems deal with time-critical coordination
of events in a geographically distributed setting. Industrial plants extensively use
networks of controllers to oversee production and maintenance. Consider a chemical plant,
in which a controller maintains the pressure of a certain chamber to 200 psi. As the vapor
Introduction ◾ 7
pressure increases, the temperature has a tendency to increase—so there is another controller
300 ft away that controls the flow of a coolant. This coolant ensures that the temperature
of the chamber never exceeds 180°F. Furthermore, the safety of the plant requires that the
product of the pressure and the temperature does not exceed 35,000. Here, the distributed
computing system maintains an invariance relationship on system parameters monitored
and controlled by independent controllers. In urban traffic control networks, the computers
at the different control points control traffic signals to minimize traffic congestion and
maximize traffic flow. Vehicular networks allow spontaneous intervehicle wireless communication,
which not only enables vehicles to share information about road conditions with
other vehicles but also opens up the possibility of improved mobility and collective safety.
Sensor networks: The declining cost of hardware and the growth of wireless technology
have led to new opportunities in the design of application-specific or special-purpose
distributed systems. One such application is a sensor network [ASSC02]. Each node is a
miniature processor equipped with a few sensors that sense various environmental parameters,
and is capable of wireless communication with other nodes. Such networks can be
potentially used in a wide class of problems: These range from battlefield surveillance,
biological and chemical attack detection, to healthcare, home automation, ecological, and
habitat monitoring. This is a part of a larger vision of ubiquitous computing.
Grid and cloud computing: Grid computing is a form of distributed computing that supports
parallel programming on a network of computers. At the low end, a computational grid
can use a fraction of the computational resources of one or two organizations, whereas at
the high end, it can combine millions of computers worldwide to work on extremely large
computational projects. The goal is to solve difficult computational problems more quickly
and less expensively than by conventional methods. We provide two examples here.
The first example is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and a
complex experimental testbed built at the European Organization of Nuclear Research
(CERN) started operation from 2008, and it is being used to answer fundamental questions
of science. The scientific experiments generate approximately 15 PB of data each
year (1 PB = 1015 bytes, and this is the equivalent of more than 20 million CDs). These
data are distributed around the globe, to 11 large computer centers located in Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Spain, Taipei, the United
Kingdom, and two sites in the United States forming a worldwide virtual organization.
These Tier-1 centers make the data available to more than 150 Tier-2 centers for specific
analysis tasks. Individual scientists at the various countries can locally access the LHC
data using local computer clusters and PCs.
The second example is the SETI@home project. Do extraterrestrials exist? SETI (acronym
for search for extraterrestrial intelligence) is a massive project aimed at discovering the
existence of extraterrestrial life in this universe. The large volume of data that is constantly
being collected from hundreds of radio telescopes needs to be analyzed to draw any conclusion
about the possible existence of extraterrestrial life. This requires massive computing
power. Rather than using supercomputers, the University of California, Berkeley, SETI team
8 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
decided to harness the idle computing power of the millions of PCs and workstations belonging
to you and me, computing power that is otherwise wasted by running useless screensaver
programs. Currently, about 40 GB of data are pulled down daily by the telescope and sent
to over three million computers all over the world to be analyzed. The results are sent back
through the Internet, and the program then collects a new segment of radio signals for the
PC to work on. The system executes 14 trillion floating-point operations per second and has
garnered over 500,000 years of PC time in the past year and a half. It would normally cost
millions of dollars to achieve that type of power on one or even two supercomputers.
Cloud computing enables clients to outsource their software usage, data storage, and even
the computing infrastructure to remote data centers. Clients interact with the cloud storage
and applications through the Internet using their web browsers. Users need not acquire
or maintain expensive hardware and software but nevertheless get their jobs done by paying
for the usage of the resources. With the extensive availability of high-speed networks
and the declining cost of computers, cloud computing provides an economic alternative to
conventional computing. It presents a flexible approach where users can increase their computing
capacity on the fly as a pay-per-use service. The task of maintaining the hardware
and software at the data centers rests with the cloud service provider, who is responsible for
overseeing the seamless sharing of these resources and maintaining privacy of user data.
1.4 IMPORTANT ISSUES IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
This book will mostly deal with process models and distributed computations supported by
these models. A model is an abstract view of a system. It ignores many physical details of
the system. That does not mean that the implementation issues are unimportant, but these
are outside the scope of this book. Thus, when discussing about a network of processes, we
will never describe the type of processors running the processes, or the characteristics of the
physical memory, or the rate at which the bits of a message are being pumped across a particular
channel. Our emphasis is on computational activities represented by the concurrent
or interleaved execution of actions on a network of sequential processes. Some of the important
issues in the study of the computational models of distributed systems are as follows:
Knowledge of a process: The knowledge of a process is local. No process is ordinarily
expected to have global knowledge about either the network topology or the global state.
Each process thus has a myopic view of the system. It is fair to expect that a process knows
(1) its own identity, (2) its own state, and (3) the identity of its immediate neighbors. In
some special cases, a process may also have exact or approximate knowledge about the size
(i.e., the number of nodes) of the network. Any other knowledge that a process might need
has to be acquired from time to time through appropriate algorithmic actions.
Network topology: A network of processes may either be completely connected or sparsely
connected. In a completely connected network, a channel (also called a link) exists between
every pair of processes in the system. This condition does not hold for a sparsely connected
topology. As a result, message routing is an important activity. A link between a pair of
processes may be unidirectional or bidirectional. Examples of sparse topologies are trees,
rings, arrays, and hypercubes (Figure 1.1).
Introduction ◾ 9
Degree of synchronization: Some of the deeper issues in distributed systems center around
the notion of synchrony and asynchrony. According to the laws of astronomy, real time is
defined in terms of the rotation of the Earth in the solar system. However, the international
time standard now is the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is the current term for
what was commonly referred to as Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT). Zero hour in UTC
is midnight in Greenwich, England, which lies on the zero longitudinal meridian. UTC
is based on a 24 h clock; therefore, afternoon hours such as 6 p.m. UTC are expressed as
18:00 UTC. Each second in UTC is precisely the time for 9,192,631,770 orbital transitions
of the cesium 133 atom. The time keeping in UTC is based on atomic clocks. UTC signals
are regularly broadcast from satellites as well as many radio stations. In the United States,
this is done from the WWV radio station in Fort Collins, Colorado, where satellite signals
are received through Global Positioning System (GPS). A useful aspect of atomic clocks is
the fact that these can, unlike solar clocks, be made available anywhere in the universe.
Assume that each process in a distributed system has a local clock. If these clocks
represent the UTC (static differences due to time zones can be easily taken care of and
ignored from this equation), then every process has a common notion of time, and the
system can exhibit synchronous behavior by the simultaneous scheduling of their actions.
Unfortunately, in practical distributed systems, this is difficult to achieve, since the drift of
the local physical clocks is a fact of life. One approach to handle this is to use a time server
that keeps all the local clocks synchronized with one another. This is good enough for
some applications, but not all.
The concept of a synchronous system has evolved over many years. There are many
facets of synchrony. One is the existence of an upper bound on the propagation delay of
messages. If the message sent by process A is not received by process B within the expected
interval of real time, then process B suspects some kind of failure. Another feature of a
synchronous system is the first-in-first-out (FIFO) behavior of the channels connecting the
processes. With these various possibilities, it seems prudent to use the attribute synchronous
to separately characterize the behaviors of clocks, or communication, or channels.
In a fully asynchronous system, not only there is clock drift, but also there is no upper
bound on the message propagation delays. Processes can be arbitrarily slow, and out-oforder
message delivery between any pair of processes is considered feasible. In other words,
such systems may completely disregard the rule of time, and processes schedule events at
(a) (b) (c)
FIGURE 1.1 Examples of network topologies: (a) ring, (b) directed tree, and (c) 3D cube. Each node
represents a process, and each edge connecting a pair of nodes represents a channel.
10 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
an arbitrary pace. The properties of a distributed system depend on the type of synchrony.
Results about one system often completely fall apart when assumptions about synchrony
change from synchronous to asynchronous. In Chapter 6, we will find out how the lack of a
common basis of time complicates the notion of global state and consequently the ordering
of events in a distributed system.
Failures: The handling of failures is an important area of study in distributed systems. A
failure occurs when a system as a whole or one or more of its components do not behave
according to their specifications. Numerous failure models have been studied. The most
common failure model is crash, where a process ceases to produce any output. In another
case of failure, a process does not stop but simply fails to send one or more messages or
execute one or more steps. This is called omission failure. This includes the case when a
message is sent but lost in transit. Sometimes, the failure of a process or a link may alter
the topology by partitioning the network into disjoint subnetworks. In the byzantine failure
model, a process may behave in a completely arbitrary manner—for example, it can
send inconsistent or conflicting message to its neighboring processes—or may execute a
program that is different from the designated one.
Along with the type of failure, its duration is of significance. It is thus possible that a
process exhibits byzantine failure for 5 s, then resumes normal behavior, and after 30 min,
fails by stopping. We will discuss more about various fault models in Chapter 12.
Scalability: An implementation of a distributed system is considered scalable when its performance
is not impaired regardless of the final scale of the system. The need for additional
resources to cope with the increased scale should be manageable. Scalability is an important
issue since many distributed systems have witnessed tremendous growth in size over
the past decade—it is quite common for current social networks to have millions of registered
users. Scalability suffers when the resource requirement grows alarmingly with the
scale of the system. Some systems deliver the expected performance when the number of
nodes is small, but fail to deliver when the number of nodes increases. From an algorithmic
perspective, the scalability is excellent when the space or time complexity of a distributed
algorithm is O(log n) or lower, where n is the number of processes in the system—
however,
when it is O(n) or higher, the scalability is considered poor. Well-designed distributed systems
usually exhibit good scalability.
1.5 COMMON SUBPROBLEMS
Most applications in distributed computing center around a set of common subproblems.
If we can solve these common subproblems in a satisfactory way, then we have a good
handle on system design. Here are a few examples of common subproblems:
Leader election: When a number of processes cooperate with one another for solving a
problem, many implementations prefer to elect one of them as the leader and the remaining
processes as followers. The leader assumes the role of a coordinator and runs a program
that is different from that of the followers. If the leader crashes, then one of the followers is
elected the leader, after which the system runs as usual.
Introduction ◾ 11
Mutual exclusion: Access to certain hardware resources is restricted to one process at a
time: an example is a printer. There are also software resources where concurrent accesses
run the risk of producing inconsistent results: for example, multiple processes are not ordinarily
allowed to update a shared data structure. Mutual exclusion guarantees that at most
one process acquires the resource or performs a critical operation on a shared data at any
time and concurrent access attempts to such resources are serialized.
Time synchronization: Local clocks invariably drift and need periodic resynchronization to
support a common notion of time across the entire distributed system.
Global state: The global state of a distributed system consists of the local states of its component
processes. Any computation that needs to compute the global state at a given time
has to read the local states of every component process at that time. However, given the
facts that local clocks are never perfectly synchronized and message propagation delays are
finite, computation of the global state is a nontrivial problem.
Multicasting: Sending of a given data to multiple processes in a distributed system is a
common subtask in many applications. As an example, in group communication, one
may want to send some breaking news to millions of members as quickly as possible. The
important issues here are efficiency, reliability, and scalability.
Replica management: To support fault tolerance and improve system availability, the use
of process replicas is quite common. When the main server is down, one of the replica
servers replaces the main server. Data replication (also known as caching) is widely used
for conserving system bandwidth. However, replication requires that the replicas be appropriately
updated. Since such updates can never be instantaneously done, it leaves open the
possibility of inconsistent replicas. How to update the replicas and what kind of response
can a client expect from these replicas? Are there different notions of consistency in replica
management? How are these related to the cost of the update operation?
1.6 IMPLEMENTING A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM
A model is an abstract view of a system. Any implementation of a distributed computing
model must involve the implementation of processes, message links, routing schemes, and
timing. The most natural implementation of a distributed system is a network of computers,
each of which runs one or more processes. Using the terminology from computer architecture,
such implementations belong to the class of loosely coupled multiple instruction
multiple data (MIMD) machines, where each processor has a private address space. The best
example of a large-scale implementation of a distributed system is the WWW. A cluster of
workstations connected to one another via a local area network (LAN) serves as a mediumscale
implementation. In a smaller scale, mobile ad hoc networks and a wireless sensor network
are appropriate examples.
Distributed systems can also be implemented on a tightly coupled MIMD machine,
where processes running on separate processors are connected to a globally shared
memory. In this implementation, the shared memory simulates the interprocess communication
channels. Finally, a multiprogrammed uniprocessor can be used to simulate
12 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
a shared-memory multiprocessor and hence a distributed system. For example, the very
old RC4000 was the first message-based operating system designed and implemented by
Brinch Hansen [BH73] on a uniprocessor. Amoeba, Mach, and Windows NT are examples
of microkernel-based operating systems where processes communicate via messages.
Distributed systems have received significant attention from computer architects because
of their potential for better scalability. In a scalable architecture, resources can be continuously
added to improve performance, and there is no appreciable bottleneck in this process.
Bus-based multiprocessors do not scale beyond 8–16 processors because the bus bandwidth
acts as a bottleneck. Shared-memory symmetric multiprocessors (also called SMPs) built
around multistage interconnection networks suffer from some degree of contention when
the number of processors reaches 1000 or more. Recent trends in scalable architecture show
reliance on multicomputers, where a large number of autonomous machines (i.e., processors
with private memories) are used as building blocks. For the ease of programming, various
forms of distributed shared memory (DSM) are then implemented on it, since programmers
do not commonly use message passing in developing application programs.
Social networks implement a version of a distributed system that can be viewed as a
graph, with the nodes representing members and the edges representing friendship relation
between members. The servers maintain the friendship relationships and oversee the
access control.
Another implementation of a distributed system is a neural network, which is a system
mimicking the operation of a human brain. A neural network contains a number of processors
operating in parallel, each with its own small sphere of knowledge and access to data in
its local memory. Such networks are initially trained by rules about data relationships (e.g.,
“A mother is older than her daughter”). A program can then tell the network how to behave in
response to input from a computer user. The results of the interaction can be used to enhance
the training. Some important applications of neural networks include stock market prediction,
weather prediction, oil exploration, and the interpretation of nucleotide sequences.
These different architectures merely serve as platforms for implementation or simulation.
A large number of system functions are necessary to complete the implementation
of a particular system. For example, many models assume communication channels to
be FIFO. Therefore, if the architecture does not naturally support FIFO communication
between a pair of processes, then FIFO communication has to be implemented first.
Similarly, many models assume there will be no loss or corruption of messages. If the
architecture does not guarantee these features, then appropriate protocols have to be used
to remedy this shortcoming. No system can be blamed for not performing properly, if the
model specifications are not appropriately satisfied.
1.7 PARALLEL VERSUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
What is the relationship between a parallel system and a distributed system? Like distributed
systems, parallel systems are yet to be clearly defined. The folklore is that any system
in which the events can at best be partially ordered is a parallel system. This naturally
includes every distributed system and all shared-memory systems with multiple threads
of control. According to this view, distributed systems form a subclass of parallel systems,
Introduction ◾ 13
where the state spaces of processes do not overlap. Processes have greater autonomy. This
view is not universally accepted. Some distinguish parallel systems from distributed systems
on the basis of their objectives: parallel systems focus on increasing performance,
whereas distributed systems focus on tolerating partial failures. As an alternative view, parallel
systems consist of processes in a single instruction single data (SIMD) type of synchronous
environment or a synchronous MIMD environment, asynchronous processes in a
shared-memory environment are the building blocks of concurrent systems, and cooperating
processes with private address spaces constitute a distributed system.
1.8 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
The book by Coulouris et al. [CDK11] contains a good overview of distributed systems
and their applications. Tel [T00] covers numerous algorithmic aspects of distributed
systems. Tannenbaum and van Steen’s book [TS07] addresses practical aspects and
implementation issues of distributed systems. Distributed operating systems have been
presented by Singhal and Shivaratri [SS94]. Greg Andrew’s book [A00] provides a decent
coverage of concurrent and distributed programming methodologies. The SETI@home
project and its current status are described in [SET02]. Akyildiz et al. [ASSC02] presents
a survey of wireless sensor networks.

pseudocode is ok.

integer N is a prime number. The system has a fixed number of processes. Initially,
only a designated process called the initiator knows N, and the final answer must
be available to the initiator. Informally describe what each process will do and what
interprocess messages will be exchanged.

Interprocess Communication
An Overview
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Interprocess communication is at the heart of distributed computing. User processes run
on host machines that are connected to one another through a network, and the network
carries signals that propagate from one process to another. These signals represent data.*
We separate interprocess communication into two parts:
Networking: This deals with how processes communicate with one another via the various
protocol layers. The important issues in networking are routing, error control, flow control,
authentication, etc. This is the internal view.
Users’ view: User processes have an abstract high-level view of the interprocess communication
medium. This is the external view. An average user does not bother about how the
communication takes place. The processes may communicate across a LAN, or through
the Internet, or a combination of these, or via shared (virtual) address space, an abstraction
that is created on a message-passing substrate to facilitate programming. Most working
distributed systems use the client–server model. A few systems also adopt the P2P model of
interprocess communication, where there is no difference between servers and clients. User
interfaces rely on programming tools available to a client for communicating with a server
or to a peer for communicating with another peer. Some tools are general, while others
are proprietary. In this chapter, we will focus mostly on the users’ view of communication.
2.1.1 Processes and Threads
A process is the execution of a program. The operating system supports multiple processes
on a processor, so multiple logical processes (LPs) can execute on the same physical processor.
Threads are lightweight processes. Like a process, each thread maintains a separate
flow of control, but threads share a common address space. Multiple threads improve the
* The word data here represents anything that can be used by a string of bits.
16 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
transparency of implementation of clients and servers and the overall performance. In a
multithreaded server, while one thread is blocked on an event, other threads carry out the
pending unrelated operations. In multicore processors, each core can support one or more
threads. Today’s multicore processors have 4–16 cores (and this number will grow), so
these processors can support a large number of threads.
2.1.2 Client–Server Model
The client–server model is a widely accepted model for designing distributed systems. Client
processes request for service, and server processes provide the desired service. A simple
example of client–server communication is the Domain Name Service (DNS)—clients
request for network addresses of Internet domain names, and DNS returns the addresses
to the clients. Another example is that of a search engine like Google. When a client
submits a query about a document, the search engine looks up its servers and returns
pointers to the web pages that can possibly contain information about that document.
Note that the designation of clients and servers is not unique and a server can be a client
of another server.
2.1.3 Middleware
Complex distributed systems have significant degrees of heterogeneity. Processes, processors,
and objects may be scattered anywhere in a network. To simplify the task of
software development, the users should not be bothered about the locations of these entities
or the kind of machines that they are on. Developers should not have to worry about
integrating enterprise software applications developed at different times, by different
vendors, or even communicating via different protocols. The layer of software that simplifies
the task of tying complex subsystems together or connecting software components
is called middleware. It is an extension of the services offered by the operating system
and is logically positioned between the application layer and the operating system layer
of the individual machines (Figure 2.1).

Interprocess Communication ◾ 17
With the rapid growth of distributed applications, middleware services are one of the
fastest-growing services. There are many services under this category. Some important
middleware services address the following issues:
1. How does a process locate another named process or object anywhere on the Internet?
2. How does a process send queries to multiple distributed databases anywhere on the
Internet?
3. How to isolate the application programs from differences in programming languages
and communication protocols?
4. How is the security of the communication guaranteed without any knowledge of the
trustworthiness of the operating systems at the two endpoints?
5. How does a mobile personal device (like a patient’s smartphone) switch to 3G/4G network
during travel and then switch to Bluetooth when it comes close to a Bluetoothenabled
PC at home?
We begin with an overview of networking. The following section is an outline of networking
and a summary of some commonly used communication protocols. Further details are
available in any textbook on networking.
2.2 NETWORK PROTOCOLS
We begin with a brief description of Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 since they are the most
widely used protocols for wired and wireless LANs.
2.2.1 Ethernet
Bob Metcalfe at Xerox PARC developed Ethernet in 1973. The network consists of a number
of computers connected with one another through a common high-speed bus. Every
machine constantly listens to the signals propagating through the bus. Because the bus is
common, at most one sender is allowed to send data at any time. However, no machine
is aware of when other machines want to send data—so several senders may try to send
simultaneously and it leads to a collision. Senders detect the collision, back off for a random
interval of time, and make another attempt to transmit data. This protocol is known
as carrier sensing multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). The protocol guarantees
that, eventually, exactly one of the contending processes becomes the bus master
and is able to use the bus for sending data.
The CSMA/CD protocol is quite similar to the informal protocol used by students to
speak with the instructor in a classroom. Under normal conditions, at most one student
should speak at any time. However, no student has an a priori knowledge of when another
student wants to speak, so a number of students may simultaneously try to raise their
hands to express their intention to speak. At the same time, every student raising a hand
constantly watches if any other hand is raised—this is collision detection. When a collision
is detected, they back off and try later. Eventually, only one hand is raised, and that student
speaks—all others wait until that student is done.
18 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
To detect collision in the Ethernet, every sender needs to wait for a minimum period of
time 2T after starting transmission, where T is the maximum time required by the signal
to travel from one node to another. If the maximum distance between a pair of nodes is
1 KM, then T ≥ (103/3×108) s* = 3.33 μs. So, after attempting a send operation, a node has
to wait for at least 6.66 μs to ensure that no one else has started data transmission. After
a node detects a collision, it waits for a period qT before attempting a retransmission,
where q is a random number. It can be mathematically demonstrated that this strategy
leads to collision avoidance with probability 1.
The data transfer rate for the original Xerox PARC Ethernet was only 3 Mb/s (three
million bits per second). In the later version of widely used Ethernets, the transfer rate
was 10 Mb/s. Technological improvements have led to the emergence of fast Ethernets
(100 Mb/s) and gigabit Ethernets (1 GB/s). Gigabit Ethernets can be used as the backbone of
a very high-speed network.
The latency of message propagation in an Ethernet depends on the degree of contention.
The term channel efficiency is used to specify the ratio of the number of packets successfully
transmitted to the theoretical maximum number of packets that could be transmitted
without collision. Typical Ethernets can accommodate up to 1024 machines.
2.2.2 Wireless Networks
The dramatic increase in the number of portable or handheld devices like smartphones has
increased the emphasis on mobile computing, also known as nomadic computing. The applications
are manifold: from accessing the Internet through your smartphone or PDA to disaster
management and communication in the battlefield. Mobile users do not always rely on
wireless connection between the two endpoints. For example, a mobile user carrying a laptop
computer may connect to a fixed network as he or she moves from one place to another.
However, for many other applications, wireless connection becomes necessary. There are
several issues that are unique to mobile communication: The portable unit is often powered
off for conserving battery power. The activities are generally short and bursty in nature, like
checking an email or making a query about whether the next flight is on time. The potential
for radio interference is much higher, making error control difficult. The administrative backbone
divides the areas of coverage into cells, and a user roaming from one cell to another has
to successfully hand off the application to the new cell without the loss or corruption of data.
Finally, the portable device may easily be lost or stolen, which poses new security problems.
In this section, we only discuss those systems that have no wired infrastructure for communication.
This includes mobile ad hoc networks but excludes networks where the wireless
communication replaces the last hop of the wired communication. The salient features
of wireless transmission are as follows:
Limited range: The range measured by the Euclidean distance across which a communication
can take place is limited. It is determined by the power of the transmitter and the
power of the battery.
* The speed of signal propagation is 3 × 108 m/s.
Interprocess Communication ◾ 19
Dynamic topology: If the nodes are mobile, then the neighborhood relationship is not
fixed. The connectivity is also altered when the sender increases the power of transmission.
Algorithms running on wireless networks must be able to adapt to changes in the
network topology.
Collision: The communication from two different processes can collide and garble the message.
Transmissions need to be coordinated so that no process is required to receive a message
from two different senders concurrently.
IEEE 802.11 defines the standards of wireless communication. The physical transmission
uses either direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) or frequency hopping spread spectrum
(FHSS), or infrared (IR). It defines a family of specifications (802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g)
(commonly called Wi-Fi) each with different capabilities. The basic IEEE 802.11 makes provisions
for data rates of either 1 or 2 Mb/s in the 2.4 GHz frequency band using DSSS or
FHSS transmission. IEEE 802.11b extends the basic 802.11 standard by allowing data rates
of 11 Mb/s in the 2.4 GHz band and uses only DSSS. 802.11g further extends the data rate
to 54 Mb/s. 802.11a also extends the basic data rate of 802.11 to 54 Mb/s, but uses a different
type of physical transmission called orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. It has a
shorter transmission range and a lesser chance of radio-frequency interference. 802.11a is
not interoperable with 802.11b or 802.11g. More recently, the 802.11n protocol uses multiple
antennas to increase data rates from 54 Mb/s (offered by 802.11a and 802.11g) to 600 Mb/s.
To control access to the shared medium, 802.11 standard specifies a carrier sense multiple
access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol that allows at most one process in
a neighborhood to transmit. As in CSMA/CD, when a node has a packet to transmit, it first
listens to ensure that no other node is transmitting. If the channel is clear, that is, no one
else within the sender’s radio range is transmitting, then it transmits the packet. However,
collision detection, as is employed in Ethernet, cannot be used for radio-frequency transmissions
of 802.11. This is because when a node is transmitting, it cannot hear any other
node in the system that may start transmitting, since its own signal will drown out others.
To resolve this, as an optional mechanism, whenever a packet is to be transmitted, the
transmitting node first sends out a short ready-to-send (RTS) packet containing information
on the length of the packet. If the receiving node hears the RTS, it responds with
a short clear-to-send (CTS) packet. After this exchange, the transmitting node sends its
packet. When the packet is received successfully as certified by a cyclic redundancy check
(CRC), the receiving node transmits an acknowledgment (ack) packet. This back-and-forth
exchange is necessary to avoid the hidden node problem. Consider three nodes A, B, C, such
that node A can communicate with node B and node B can communicate with node C,
but node A cannot communicate with node C. As a result, although node A may sense the
channel to be clear, node C may in fact be transmitting to node B. The protocol described
earlier alerts node A that node B is busy, and hence it must wait before transmitting its
packet. CSMA/CA significantly improves bandwidth utilization.
A wireless sensor network consists of a set of primitive computing elements (called sensor
nodes or motes) capable of communicating by radio waves. Each node has one or more
sensors that can sense the physical parameters of the environment around it and report
20 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
it to the neighbors within its transmission range. The use of wireless sensor networks has
substantially grown in the past 10 years. In some large-scale applications, the number of
motes can scale to a few thousand. Protocols pay special attention to the power consumption
and battery life. To conserve power, processes adopt a variety of techniques, including
periodically switching to the sleep mode (that consumes very little battery power).
Maintaining good clock synchronization and sender–receiver coordination turns out to
be an important issue.
The topology of a wireless network depends on the power level used for transmission.
Consider the nodes 0–6 in Figure 2.2a. The nodes 0, 1, 2 are within the radio range of
node 3, but outside the ranges of nodes 4, 5, 6. Nodes 0, 1, 2 are within the radio range of one
another. Nodes 3, 4, 6 are within the range of node 5. Finally, nodes 4 and 6 are within each
other’s range. The corresponding topology of the network is shown in Figure 2.2b. To broadcast
across the entire network, at most three broadcast steps are required—this corresponds
to the diameter of the network. The topology will change if a different level of power is used.
A useful goal here is to minimize power consumption while maximizing connectivity.
2.2.3 OSI Model
Communication between users belonging to the same network or different networks
requires the use of appropriate protocols. A protocol is a collection of data encoding standards
and message exchange specifications that the sender and the receiver processes
follow for completing a specific task. Protocols should be logically correct and well documented,
and their implementations should be error-free. The International Standards
Organization (ISO) recommends such protocols for a variety of networking applications.
The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model adopted by ISO is a framework for such a
protocol. It has seven layers (Figure 2.3) and serves as a reference for discussing other network
protocols.
To understand the idea behind a protocol layer, consider the president of a company
sending a proposal to the president of another company. The president explains the idea
to her secretary. The secretary converts it to a proposal in the appropriate format and
then hands it over to the person in charge of dispatching letters. Finally, that person

sends out the letter. In the receiving company, the proposal papers follow the reverse
direction, that is, a person in the dispatch section first receives it and then gives the proposal
to the secretary to the president, who delivers it to the president.
Communication between two processes follows a similar pattern. Each protocol layer
can be compared to a secretary or a clerk. Breaking a large task into layers of abstraction is
an accepted way of mastering software complexity. Furthermore, appropriate error control
mechanisms at the lower layers ensure that the best possible information percolates to the
top layer or the application layer. The roles of the different layers in OSI are summarized
in the following:
Application layer: This layer caters to specific application needs of the user processes.
Examples are email, bulletin boards, chat rooms, web applications, and directory services.
Presentation layer: Data representation formats may vary between the sender and the
receiver machines. This layer resolves the compatibility problems by addressing the syntactic
differences in data representation. Mime encoding/decoding, data compression/
decompression, and encryption/decryption are addressed in this layer. The presentation
layer also contains user interface components—these include ASP.NET web forms or
Microsoft® Windows forms that contain codes to perform the functions of configuring the
visual appearance of controls, acquiring and rendering data for business components, etc.
Session layer: The connection between the processes at the two endpoints is established and
maintained at this level for all connection-oriented communications. Once a connection is
established, all references to the remote machine use a session address. Such a session can
be used for ftp, telnet, etc.

FIGURE 2.3 The seven-layer OSI model.
22 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Transport layer: The goal of the transport layer is to provide end-to-end communication
between the sender and the receiver processes. Depending on the error control mechanism
used, such communications may be unreliable or reliable. Well-known examples of transport
layer protocols are transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol
(UDP). Each message is targeted towards a destination process with a unique IP address on
the Internet. The IP address may either be a permanent or a temporary one when a DHCP
server is used. Note that the messages are not yet divided into packets.
Network layer: The network layer provides machine-to-machine communication and is
responsible for message routing. Messages are broken down into packets of a prescribed size
and format. Each packet is treated as an autonomous entity and is routed through the routers
to the destination node. Two kinds of communications are possible: In virtual circuits,
first, a connection is established from the sender to the receiver, and then packets arrive at
the destination in the same order in which they are sent. Datagrams do not require a connection
establishment phase. Out-of-order delivery of messages is possible, and the transport
layer handles the task of packet resequencing. Some important issues in this layer are
routing via shortest path or minimum hops, avoiding deadlocks during packet switching,
etc. In a LAN, routing activity is nonexistent. IP is a network layer protocol in WAN.
Data link layer: This layer assembles the stream of bits into frames and appends error control
bits (like cyclic redundancy codes) to safeguard against corruption of messages in transit.
The receiver acknowledges the receipt of each frame, following which the next frame is
sent out. Different data link protocols use different schemes for sending acks. Requests for
retransmission of lost or corrupted frames are handled through an appropriate dialogue.
Physical layer: This layer deals with how a bit is sent across a channel. In electrical communication,
the issue is what voltage levels (or what frequencies) are to be used to represent
a 0 or a 1. In optical communication, the corresponding issue is what kind of light signals
(i.e., amplitude and wavelength) is to be sent across fiber-optic links to represent a 0 or a 1.
The layers of protocols form a protocol stack or a protocol suite. The protocol stack defines
the division of responsibilities. In addition, in each layer, some error control mechanism
is incorporated to safeguard against possible malfunctions of that layer. This guarantees
that the best possible information is forwarded to the upper layers. The OSI protocol stack
provides a framework meant to encourage the development of nonproprietary software in
open systems. Real protocol suites do not always follow the OSI guidelines. However, in
most cases, the activities belonging to a particular layer of a real protocol can be mapped
to the activities of one or more layers of the OSI protocol.
2.2.4 IP
Internetworking aims at providing a seamless communication system across a pair of computers
on the Internet. The Internet protocol (IP) defines the method for sending data from one
computer (also called a host) to another. Addressing is a critical part of Internet abstraction.
Each computer has at least one IP address that uniquely distinguishes it from all other computers
on the Internet. The message to be sent is divided into packets. Each packet contains
Interprocess Communication ◾ 23
the Internet address of both the sender and the receiver. IP is a connectionless protocol, which
means it requires no continuing connection between the end hosts. Every packet is sent to a
router (also called a gateway) that reads the destination address and forwards the packet to
an adjacent router, which in turn reads the destination address and so forth, until one router
recognizes that the destination of the packet is a computer in its immediate neighborhood
or domain. That router then forwards the packet directly to the computer whose address is
specified. Each packet can take a different route across the Internet, and packets can arrive in
an order that is different from the order they were transmitted. This kind of service is a besteffort
service. If the reception has to be error-free and the reception order has to be the same
as the transmission order, then one needs another protocol like TCP.
The most widely used version of IP today is still IP Version 4 (IPv4) with a 32-bit address.
However, the adoption of IP Version 6 (IPv6) is growing. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses and
can potentially accommodate many more Internet users. IPv6 includes the capabilities of
IPv4 but does not provide downward compatibility—although the two implementations
can coexist via dual-stack servers. In addition to the expanded address space, the deployment
of IPv6 is targeted at the better handling of mobility, quality of service (QoS), multicasting,
privacy extension, and so on. Although the global IP6 traffic is currently a little
above 1%, it is scheduled to replace IP4 in the next few years.
On an Ethernet, each source and destination node has a 48-bit hardware address, called
the medium access control address (MAC address) stored in its network interface card. The
MAC address is used by the data link layer protocols. The IP addresses are mapped to the
48-bit hardware addresses using the address resolution protocol (ARP). The ARP client and
server processes operate on all computers using IP over Ethernet.
2.2.5 Transport Layer Protocols
Two common transport layer protocols are UDP and TCP.
UDP/IP: UDP uses IP to send and receive data packets, but packet reception may not follow
the transmission order. UDP is a connectionless protocol. The application program must ensure
that the entire message arrived and in the right order. UDP provides two services not provided
by the IP layer. It provides port numbers to help distinguish different user requests and a checksum
capability to verify that the data arrived intact. UDP can detect errors but drops packets
with errors. Network applications that want to save processing time because messages are short
or occasional errors have no significant impact prefer UDP. Others use TCP.
TCP/IP: The TCP running over IP is responsible for overseeing the reliable and efficient
delivery of data between a sender and a receiver. Data can be lost in transit. TCP adds support
to the recovery of lost data by triggering retransmission, until the data are correctly
and completely received in the proper sequence. By doing so, TCP implements a reliable
stream service between a pair of ports in the sender and the receiver processes.
Unlike UDP, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol—so actual data communication
is preceded by a connection establishment phase and terminated by a connection termination
phase. The basic idea behind error control in TCP is to add sequence number to
the packets prior to transmission and monitor the ack received for each packet from the
24 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
destination process. If the ack is not received within a window of time that is a reasonable
estimate of the turnaround delay, then the message is retransmitted. The receiving process
sends an ack only when it receives a packet with the expected sequence number.
Transmission errors can occur for a variety of reasons. Figure 2.4 shows a slice of the
Internet. Assume that each of the two users 1 and 2 are simultaneously sending messages
to user 3 at the rate of 8 MB/s. However, LAN D, to which user 3 is connected, is
unable to handle incoming data at a rate exceeding 10 MB/s. In this situation, there are two
possible options:
Option 1: The router can drop the packets that LAN D is unable to handle.
Option 2: The router can save the extra packets in its local memory and transmit them to
LAN D at a future time.
Option 2 does not rule out packet loss, since each router has a limited amount of memory.
Among many tasks, TCP/IP helps recover lost packets, reorder them, and reject duplicate
packets before they are delivered to the destination process. For the efficient use of the
transmission medium, TCP allows multiple data packets to be transmitted before the ack
to the first packet is received. TCP has a mechanism to estimate the round-trip time and
limit data rates to clear out congestions.
TCP/IP provides a general framework over which many services can be built and
message-passing distributed algorithms can be implemented. Despite occasional criticisms,
it has successfully carried out its mission for many years, tolerating many changes
in network technology.
2.2.6 Interprocess Communication Using Sockets
Sockets are abstract endpoints of communication between a pair of processes. Developed
by Berkeley Software Distribution as a part of BSD UNIX, sockets are integrated into
the I/O part of the operating system. Sockets are of two types: stream sockets and

datagram sockets. Stream sockets use TCP/IP, and datagram sockets use UDP/IP. The
steps involved in a client–server communication using sockets are as follows:
First, a client process requests the operating system to create a socket by making the
socket system call, and a descriptor identifying the socket is returned to the client. Then
it uses the connect system call to connect to a port of the server. Once the connection is
established, the client communicates with the server.
Like the client, the server process also uses the socket system call to create a socket.
Once created, the bind system call will assign a port number to the socket. If the protocol
is a connectionless protocol like UDP, then the server is ready to receive packets.
For connection-oriented protocols like TCP, the server first waits to receive a connection
request by calling a listen procedure. The server eventually accepts the connection using
the accept system call. Following this, the communication begins. After the communication
is over, the connection is closed.
A port number is a 16-bit entity. Of the 216 possible ports, some (0–1023) are reserved
for standard services. For example, server port number 21 is for FTP, port 22 is for Secure
Shell (SSH) remote login, and port number 23 is for telnet. An example of a socket program
in Java is shown in the following:
/* Client.java sends a request to Server to do a computation */

import java.io.*;
class Client {
public static void main (String []args) {

/* BufferedReader to read from the socket */
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader(sk.
getInputStream ()));
/* PrintWriter to write to the socket */
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sk.getOutputStream(), true);
/*Sending request for computation to the server from an imaginary

String request = getRequest();
/* Sending the request to the server */
out.println(request);
/* Reading the result from the server */
String result = in.readLine();
System.out.println(“ The result is ” + result);
}
catch(IOException e) {
System.out.println(“ Exception raised: ” + e);
}

2.3 NAMING
In this section, we look into the important middleware service of naming built on top of
TCP/IP or UDP/IP. A name is a string of characters or bytes, and it identifies an entity. The
entity can be just about anything—it can be a user, or a machine, or a process, or a file.
An example of a name is the URL of a website on the WWW. Naming is a basic service
using which entities can be identified and accessed only by name, regardless of where they
are located. A user can access a file by providing the filename to the file manager. To log
in to a remote machine, a user has to provide a login name. On the WWW, the Domain
Name Service (DNS) maps domain names to IP addresses. Users cannot send emails to one
another unless they can name one another by their email addresses. Note that an address
can also be viewed as a name. The ARP uses the IP address to look up the MAC address of
the receiving machine.
Each name must be associated with a unique entity, although a given entity may have
different aliases. As an example, consider the name Alice. Can it be associated with a
unique person in the universe? No. Perhaps Alice can be identified using a unique phone
Interprocess Communication ◾ 27
number, but Alice may have several telephone lines, so she may have several phone numbers.
If Alice switches her job, then she can move to a new city, and her phone number will
change. How do we know if we are communicating with the same Alice?
This highlights the importance of location independence in naming. Notice that mobile
phone numbers are location independent. The email addresses in Gmail or Hotmail
accounts are also not tied to any physical machine and are therefore location independent.
A consistent naming scheme, location independence, and a scalable naming service are
three cornerstones of a viable naming system for distributed applications.
A naming service keeps track of a name and the attributes of the object that it refers
to. Given a name, the service looks up the corresponding attributes. This is called name
resolution. For a single domain like a LAN, this is quite simple. However, on the Internet,
there are many networks and multiple domains,* so the implementation of a name service
is not trivial.
Names follow a tree structure, with the parent being a common suffix of the names of
the subtree under it. Thus, cs.uiowa.edu is a name that belongs to the domain uiowa.edu.
The prefix cs for the computer science department can be assigned only with permission
from the administrators of the domain uiowa.edu. However, for the names hp.cs.uiowa.edu
or linux.cs.uiowa.edu, it is the system administrator of the computer science department
who assigns the prefixes hp or linux. Two different name spaces can be merged into a single
name space by appending their name trees as subtrees to a common parent at a higher
level. Figure 2.5 shows a naming tree for the generation of email ids. The leaves reflect the
names of the users.
* On a single domain, a single administrative authority has the jurisdiction of assigning names.

FIGURE 2.5 A naming hierarchy.
28 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
2.3.1 Domain Name Service
Consider the task of translating a fully qualified name cs.uiowa.edu. DNS servers are logically
arranged in a hierarchy that matches the naming hierarchy. Each server has authority
over a part of the naming hierarchy. A root server has authority over the top-level domains
like .edu, .com, .org, and .gov. The root server for .edu does not know the names of the computers
at uiowa.edu, but it knows how to reach the server. An organization can place all its
domain names on a single server or place them on several different servers.
When a DNS client needs to look up a name, it queries DNS servers to resolve the name.
Visualize the DNS as a central table that contains more than a billion entries of the form
(name, IP address). Clearly, no single copy of such a table can be accessed by millions of
users at the same time. In fact, no one maintains a single centralized database of this size
anywhere. It operates as a large distributed database. For the sake of availability, different
parts of this table are massively replicated and distributed over various geographic locations.
There is a good chance that a copy of a part of the DNS service is available with your
Internet service provider or the system administrator of your organization. Each server
contains links to other domain name servers. DNS is an excellent example of how replication
enhances availability and scalability.
To resolve a name, each resolver places the specified name into a DNS request message
and forwards it to the local server. If the local server has sole authority over the requested
name, then it immediately returns the corresponding IP address. This is likely when you
want to send a message to your colleague in the same office or the same institute. However,
consider a user from uiowa.edu looking for a name like boomerang.com that is outside the
authority of uiowa’s local DNS server. In this case, the local server becomes a client and
forwards the request to an upper-level DNS server that deals with .edu. However, since
no server in .edu knows which other server has the authority over boomerang.com, a simple
solution is to send the request to the root server. The root server may not have direct
authority, but it knows the address of the next level server that may have the authority. In
this manner, the request propagates through a hierarchy of servers and finally reaches the
one that has the authority over the requested name. The returned IP address eventually
reaches the resolver via the return path.
The name servers for the top-level names do not change frequently. In fact, the IP
addresses of the root servers will rarely change. How does the root server know which
server might have authority over the desired domain boomerang.com? At the time of
domain registration, the registrant informs the DNS registry about the IP address of the
name servers that will have authority over this domain. As new subdomains are added, the
registry is updated.
The mechanism presented earlier will be unworkable without replication and caching
at various levels. With millions of users simultaneously using the WWW, the traffic at or
near the root servers will be so enormous that the system will break down. Replication of
the root servers is the first step to reduce the overload. Depending on the promptness of
the response, the DNS server responsible for the local node uses one of the root servers.
More importantly, each server has a cache that stores a copy of the names that have been
Interprocess Communication ◾ 29
recently resolved. With every new lookup, the cache is updated unless the cache already
contains that name. Before forwarding a name to a remote DNS server, the client cache is
first looked up. If the name is found there, then the translation is the fastest.
The naming service exhibits good locality—a name that has just been resolved is likely
to be accessed again in the near future. Naturally, caching expedites name resolution, and
local DNS servers are able to provide effective service.
The number of levels in a domain name has an upper bound of 127, and each label in the
name can contain up to 63 characters, as long as the whole domain name does not exceed a
total length of 255 characters. But in practice, some domain registries require a shorter limit.
2.3.2 Naming Service for Mobile Clients
Mapping the names of mobile clients to addresses is tricky, since their addresses can
change without notice. A simple method for translation uses broadcasting. To look up
Alice, broadcast the query Where is Alice? The machine that currently hosts Alice or the
access point to which Alice is connected will return its address in response to the query.
On Ethernet-based LANs, this is the essence of the ARP, where the IP address is used to
look up the MAC address of a machine having that IP address. While this is acceptable on
Ethernets where broadcasts are easily implemented by the available hardware, on larger
networks, this is inefficient. In such cases, a location service fills the gap.
Location service: The naming service will first convert each name to a unique identifier.
For example, the naming service implemented through a telephone directory will always
map your name to your local telephone number. A separate location service will accept this
unique identifier as the input and return the current address of the client (in this example,
the client’s current telephone number).
While the ARP implements a simple location service, a general location service relies
on message redirection. The implementation is comparable to call forwarding. Mobile IP
uses a home agent for location service. While moving away from home or from one location
to another, the client updates the home agent about her current location or address.
Communications to the client are directed as a care-of address to the home agent. The
home agent forwards the message to the client and also updates the sender with the current
address of the client.
2.4 REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL
Consider a server providing service to a set of clients. In a trivial setting when the clients
and the server are distinct processes residing on the same machine, the communication
uses nothing more than a system call. As an example, assume that a server allocates memory
to a number of concurrent processes. The client can use two procedures: allocate and
free. Procedure allocate(m) allocates m blocks of memory to the calling client by returning
a pointer to a free block in the memory. Procedure free(addr, m) releases m blocks of
memory from the designated address addr. Being on the same machine, the implementation
is straightforward. However, in a distributed system, there is no guarantee (and in fact
30 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
it is unlikely) that clients and servers will run on the same machine. Procedure calls can
cross machine boundaries and domain boundaries. This makes the implementation of the
procedure call much more complex. A remote procedure call (RPC) is a procedure call that
helps a client communicate with a server running on a different machine that may belong to
a different network and a different administrative domain.* Gone is the support for shared
memory. Any implementation of RPC has to take into account the passing of client’s call
parameters to the server machine and returning the response to the client machine.
2.4.1 Implementing RPC
The client calling a remote procedure blocks itself until it receives the result (or a message
signaling completion of the call) from the server. Note that clients and servers have different
address spaces. To make matters worse, crashes are not ruled out. To achieve transparency,
the client’s call is redirected to a client stub procedure in its local operating system.
The stub function provides the local procedure call interface to the remote function. First,
the client stub (1) packs the parameters of the call into a message and (2) sends the message
to the server. Then the client blocks itself. The task of packing the parameters of the call
into a message is called parameter marshaling.
On the server side, a server stub handles the message. Its role is complementary to the
role of the client stub. The server stub first unpacks the parameters of the call (this is known
as unmarshaling) and then calls the local procedure. The result is marshaled and sent back
to the client’s machine. The client stub unmarshals the parameters and returns the result
to the client (Figure 2.6). The operation of the stubs in an RPC is summarized as follows:
Client Stub Server Stub (Repeats the Following)
Pack parameters into a message Do no message → skip od
Send message to remote machine Unpack the call parameters
Do no result → skip od* Call the server procedure

Interprocess Communication ◾ 31
The lack of similarity between the client and server machines adds a level of complexity
to the implementation of RPC. For example, the client machine may use the big-endian format,
and the server machine may use the little-endian format. Passing pointers is another
headache since the address spaces are different. To resolve such issues, the client and the
server need to have a prior agreement regarding RPC protocols.
The synchronization between the client and the server can take various forms. While
the previous outline blocks the client until the result becomes available, there are nonblocking
versions too. In a nonblocking RPC, the client continues with unrelated activities
after initiating the RPC. When the server sends the result, the client is notified, and it
accepts the result.
Finally, network failures add a new twist to the semantics of RPC. Assume that the
message containing a client’s RPC is lost en route the server. The client has little alternative
to waiting and reinitiating the RPC after a time-out period. However, if for some
reason the first RPC is not lost but stuck somewhere in the network, then there is a chance
that the RPC may be executed twice. In some cases, it makes little difference. For example,
if the RPC reads the blocks of a file from a remote server, then the client may not care if
the same blocks are retrieved more than once. However, if the RPC debits your account in
a remote bank and the operation is carried out more than once, then you will be unhappy.
Some applications need the at-least-once semantics, whereas some others need the atmost-
once semantics or the exactly once semantics.
2.4.2 Sun ONC/RPC
To implement client–server communication in the network file service, Sun Microsystems*
developed the open network computing RPC (ONC/RPC) mechanism, which is also packaged
with many UNIX installations. Client–server communication is possible through
either UDP/IP or TCP/IP. An interface definition language (called external data representation
[XDR]) defines a set of procedures as a part of the service interface. Each interface
has a unique program number and a version number, and these are available from a central
authority. Clients and servers must verify that they are using the same version number.
These numbers are passed on as a parameter in the request message from the client to the
server. Sun ONC uses an RPC compiler (rpcgen) that automatically generates the client and
server stubs.
Sun RPC allows a single argument to be passed from the client to the server and a
single result from the server to the client. Accordingly, if there are multiple parameters,
then they have to be passed on as a structured variable. At the server end, a service
demon process called port mapper receives the RPC request. Clients can easily locate
the port mapper since it is always on a designated port (port 111). ONC identifies each
procedure by three parameters: program number, version number, and procedure number.
Procedure 0 is the null procedure. The client queries the port mapper to find out the
port number of the program and its version number. The port mapper binds the RPC to
* Now acquired by Oracle.
32 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
designated ports on the client and the server machines. Many different types of authentications
can be incorporated in ONC/RPC—these include the traditional (uid, gid) of
UNIX to the Kerberos type authentication service (see Chapter 19).
2.5 REMOTE METHOD INVOCATION
Remote method invocation (RMI) is a generalization of RPC in an object-oriented environment.
The object resides on the server’s machine that is different from the client’s
machine. This is known as remote object. An object for which the instance of the data
associated with it is distributed across machines is known as a distributed object. An
example of a distributed object is an object that is replicated over two or more machines.
A remote object is a special case of a distributed object where the associated data are available
on one remote machine.
To realize the scope of RMI (vis-à-vis RPC), recall the implementation of an RPC
using sockets. In RPC, objects are passed by value; thus, the current state of the remote
object is copied and passed from the server to the client, necessary updates are done,
and the modified state of the object is sent back to the server. If multiple clients try to
concurrently access/update the remote object by invoking methods in this manner, then
the updates made by one client may not be reflected in the updates made by another client,
unless such updates are serialized. In addition, the propagation of multiple copies
of the remote object between the server and the various clients will consume significant
bandwidth of the network.
RMI solves these problems in a transparent way. The various classes of the java.rmi
package allow the clients to access objects residing on remote hosts, as if, by reference,
instead of by value. Once a client obtains a reference to a remote object, it can invoke the
methods on these remote objects as if they existed locally. All modifications made to the
object through the remote object reference are reflected on the server and are available to
other clients. The client is not required to know where the server containing the remote
object is located—it only invokes a method through an interface called a proxy. The proxy
is a client stub responsible for marshaling the invocation parameters and unmarshaling
the results from the server (Figure 2.7). On the server side, a server stub called a skeleton
unmarshals the client’s invocations, invokes the desired method, and marshals the results
back to the client. For each client, there is a separate proxy, which is a separate object in the
client’s address space.
When multiple clients concurrently access a remote object, the invocations of the
methods are serialized, as in a monitor.* Some clients are blocked until their turns
come, while others make progress. The implementation of the serialization mechanism
is trivial for local objects, but for remote objects, it is tricky. For example, if the server
handles the blocking and the current client accessing the remote object crashes, then
all clients will be blocked forever. On the other hand, if clients handle blocking, then a
client needs to block itself before its proxy sends out the method call. How will a client
* A synchronization mechanism originally invented by C.A.R. Hoare and Per Brinch Hansen.
Interprocess Communication ◾ 33
know if another client has already invoked a method for the remote object? Clearly, the
implementation of serializability for remote objects requires additional coordination
among clients.
Java RMI passes local and remote objects differently. All local objects are passed by
value, while remote objects are passed by reference. While calling by value, the states of
objects are explicitly copied and included in the body of the method call. An example of
a call by reference is as follows: Each proxy contains (1) the network address of the server
S1 containing a remote object X and (2) the name of the object X in that server. As a part
of an RMI in another server S2, the client passes the proxy (containing the reference to X)
to the server S2. Now S2 can access X on S1. Since each process runs on the same Java virtual
machine, no further work is required following the unmarshaling of the parameters
despite the heterogeneity of the hardware platforms.
2.6 MESSAGES
Most distributed applications are implemented using message passing. The messaging layer
is logically located just above the TCP/IP or the UDP/IP layer, but below the application
layer. The implementation of sockets at the TCP or the UDP layer helps processes address
one another using specific socket addresses.
2.6.1 Transient and Persistent Messages
Messages can be transient or persistent. In transient communication, a message is lost
unless the receiver is active at the time of the message delivery and retrieves it during the
life of the application. An example is the interprocess communication via message buffers
in a shared memory multiprocessor. In persistent communication, messages are not lost,
but saved in a buffer for possible future retrieval. Recipients eventually receive the messages
even if they were passive at the time of message delivery. An example is email communication.
Messages are sent from the source to the destination via a sequence of routers,
each of which manages a message queue.

2.6.2 Streams
Consider sending a video clip from one user to another. Such a video clip is a stream of
frames. In general, streams are sequences of data items. Communication using streams
requires a connection to be established between the sender and the receiver. In streams
for multimedia applications, the QoS is based on the temporal relationship (like the number
of frames per second or the propagation delay) among items in the stream, and its
implementation depends on the available network bandwidth, buffer space in the routers,
and processing speeds of the end machines. One way to guarantee the QoS is to reserve
appropriate resources before communication starts. RSVP is a transport-level protocol for
reserving resources at the routers.
2.7 WEB SERVICES
Web services provide a different way of using the Internet for a variety of applications
based on machines communicating with one another over the WWW. One can design an
application on a machine by using data from the website hosted by a different machine. For
example, a user can implement a service on her smartphone using a city transit’s website
to obtain information about the latest bus schedule and set an alarm to remind about the
departure time for catching the bus at a particular stop. Another user can design an application
by pulling data from the website of a popular restaurant, so that whenever they will
have her special dish for dinner on the menu, she will receive a text message. Web services
are a form of middleware that helps to integrate applications. They facilitate applications
talking to one another.
Historically, Microsoft pioneered web services as a part of their .NET initiative.
Today, most web services are based on XML that is widely used for cross-platform data
communication—
these include simple object access protocol (SOAP); web service description
language (WSDL) and universal description, discovery, and integration specification
(UDDI); and Java web services.
WSDL describes the public interface to the web service. It is an XML-based service
description that describes how a client should communicate using the web service. These
include protocol bindings and message formats required to interact with the web services
listed in its directory. A client can find out what functions are available on the web service
and use SOAP to make the function call.
SOAP allows a one-way message containing a structured data to be sent from one process
to another using any transport protocol like TCP or HTTP or SMTP. The message
exchange is completed when the recipient sends a reply back to the sender. One can use a
Java API for an XML-based RPC implementation using SOAP to make RPCs on the server
application. A standard way to map RPC calls to SOAP messages allows the infrastructure
to automatically translate between method invocations and SOAP messages at run time,
without redesigning the code around the web service platform.
XML is virtually a ubiquitous standard. The attention is now focused on the next level
of standards derived from XML—UDDI, WSDL, and SOAP. The rapid growth of web services
to access the information stored in diverse databases makes some people wary about
privacy questions.

2.8 EVENT NOTIFICATION
Event notification systems help establish a form of asynchronous communication among
distributed objects on heterogeneous platforms and have numerous applications. An example
is the publish–subscribe middleware. Consider the airfares that are regularly published
by the different airlines on the WWW. You are planning a vacation in Hawaii, so you may
want to be notified of an event when the round-trip airfare from your nearest airport to
Hawaii drops below $400. This illustrates the nature of publish–subscribe communication.
Here, you are the subscriber of the event. Neither publishers nor subscribers are required to
know anything about one another, but communication is possible via a brokering arrangement.
Such event notification schemes are similar to interrupts or exceptions in a centralized
environment. By definition, they are asynchronous.
Here are a few other examples. A smart home may send a phone call to its owner away
from home whenever the garage door is open, or there is a running faucet, or there is a
power outage. In a collaborative work environment, processes can resume the next phase
of work, when everyone has completed the current phase of the work—these can be notified
as events. In an intensive care unit of a medical facility, physicians can define events
for which they need notification. Holders of stocks may want to be notified whenever the
price of their favorite stock goes up by more than 5%. An airline passenger would like to be
notified via an app in her smartphone if the time of the connecting flight changes.
Apache River (originally Jini developed by Sun Microsystems) provides event notification
service for Java-based platforms. It allows subscribers in one Java virtual machine
(JVM) to receive notification of events of interest from another JVM. The essential components
are as follows:
1. An event generator interface, where users may register their events of interest.
2. A remote event listener interface that provides notification to the subscribers by
invoking the notify method. Each notification is an instance of the remote event class.
It is passed as an argument to the notify method.
3. Third-party agents play the role of observers and help coordinate the delivery of similar
events to a group of subscribers.
Apples’s iOS running on iPhones or iPads uses the push notification service for sending
notification of events to users via a short text message or a sound byte.
2.9 VIRTUALIZATION: CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing is an environment in which your data and/or programs are not stored or
managed by your own machine, but done by a third party: the cloud, who offers this as a
service. You can access your data or results of your computation through a browser that is
a part of every computer system. Cloud computing is the convergence of several technologies,
like distributed computing, cluster computing, and web services.
Even before the term cloud computing was coined, the concept was getting momentum
under various names. All the web applications are now included under cloud computing.
36 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Many of us use Google mail or Yahoo mail to store and access email messages. These emails are
stored in the servers managed by the respective companies. Google Doc allows users to
upload, edit, and retrieve documents to Google’s data servers for the purpose of sharing.
YouTube hosts millions of user-uploaded videos and allows us to store and share our videos
with others without any cost. Many of us routinely use Flickr and Picasa to upload and share
millions of our personal digital photographs. Social networking sites like Facebook allow
members to post pictures and videos that are stored in the site’s servers.
Not only for the dedicated cloud enthusiasts but also for the average users, Amazon’s
Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2) virtual computing environment might be the answer to
all the needs. Rather than purchasing servers, software, network equipment, and so on,
users would buy into a fully outsourced set of online services instead. The users need not
care about where these servers are geographically located—they are all part of the cloud,
residing in a single data center or distributed across a number of data centers and controlled
by a single organization.* This not only subscribes to the concept of virtualization
but also reinforces the concept of pay-as-you-use or utility computing, where the users pay
a metered price in exchange for the service. There is no upfront investment and it allows
flexible scaling of resources. Above all, the current prices for such services (as of December
2013) are extremely reasonable—for an average student user job running for an hour or so,
it costs pennies only.
To use a cloud service like Amazon’s EC2, note that Amazon web service (AWS) is the
umbrella of all services provided by Amazon, including EC2. So once a user signs up for
AWS, she can go to the EC2 link to create her virtual server and access it using her remote
desktop connection.
2.9.1 Classification of Cloud Services
Some cloud platforms offer a mix of proprietary development and application packages,
while others are simply metered services. To distinguish between the various forms, cloud
services have been classified into software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS),
and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), respectively:
SaaS: It is the most basic among these services. Think of Google Docs. Creating a Google
account is free. Once you have an account, all you have to do is log in to google.com/docs and
you instantly have access to a powerful word processor, spreadsheet application, and presentation
creator. Google makes all these services available to you, and you can manage everything
from the web browser without installing anything else on your machine. Dropbox,
Salesforce.com, etc., are applications that qualify as SaaS and the basic services are free.
PaaS: PaaS facilitates the development of an application that will run in a specific cloud
environment. One can utilize the available infrastructure and tools of an established environment.
This also gives the developer the ability to quickly make her app available to a

domains.

wide audience. For example, on the Facebook platform, developers can write new applications
and make them available to other users of that platform. Google Apps provides APIs
and functionalities that facilitate developers to build web applications by leveraging its different
services such as maps and calendar. These are very handy for developing lightweight
web applications.
IaaS: This is the most comprehensive cloud platform and is mainly used by full-time developers
or large-scale enterprise customers or by occasional users who have the IT skills but
don’t have the infrastructure. While SaaS allows usage of cloud apps, and PaaS allows you to
develop apps, IaaS gives you infrastructure for developing, running, and storing your apps
in cloud environments. The benefit of IaaS is the virtually limitless storage and computing
power available to the developers without having any physical hardware on site. Amazon
EC2 is a great example of IaaS. From the smallest application to full-scale websites needed
for launching a business, EC2 provides the necessary cloud infrastructure. Users have the
freedom to develop using an assortment of tools, from MySQL to Ruby on Rails, and can
choose from several Linux or Windows environments.
With the growth of cloud computing, the number of data centers is also growing at a
rapid pace. Each data center is equipped with thousands of processors whose collective
computing speed adds up to the petaflop range, virtually unlimited storage, and highspeed
networking facility. Many of these data centers are automatically and remotely managed
without any human operator being around. Energy is a big budget item for these data
centers, as well as water usage that is needed for cooling. The enormous volume of water
required to cool high-density server farms is making water management a growing priority
for data center operators. A 15 MW data center can use up to 360,000 gal of water a
day [M09].
2.9.2 MapReduce
One significant feature of modern day distributed systems is the large volume of data that
they are expected to handle. Photos and audio and video recordings are continuously created
and passed to the social network sites. Amazon and eBay routinely deal with enormous
volumes of data from all over the world. The search engines Google, Yahoo, and
Bing routinely crunch enormous amount of data to process user queries from all over the
world. Massively parallel data processing engines have become indispensable for generating
prompt responses in these scenarios. To crunch massive volumes of data, Google
invented MapReduce in 2004, and in 2007, Yahoo made it into the open-source project
Hadoop that is essentially an operating system to enable MapReduce programs to run on
computing clusters.
MapReduce algorithms efficiently harness the built-in parallelism exhibited by many
large-scale or data-intensive problems. To design such algorithms, one has to start with the
two basic operations: map and reduce. The function map applies a specific function to all
the elements of a list, and their execution is meant to run in parallel. Each process or thread
is assigned one such task. The function reduce is an aggregation operation that takes the
output of the map operation and aggregates to a final result.
38 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The basic data structure in MapReduce is the <key, value> pairs. If x = 5, then the key
is the integer variable x, and its value is 5. For a graph, the key may be the identifier of a
node and its value may be the list of its neighbors. For a web page, the key is its URL, and
the value is the HTML code for that page. In the succeeding text, we illustrate a typical
application of MapReduce via an example: A directory D has a number of text files, each
containing some text—our goal is to capture and count every occurrence of the word
dog and every occurrence of the word cat in these two files and produce the cumulative
result for each.
{Pseudocode for the word count problem}
1: Mapper (directory D; file f)
2: for every term “dog” in file f do
3: Output (“dog”, value 1)
1: Reducer (term “dog”; set of values)
2: total: = 0
3: for each t in set of values do
4: total: = total + t
5: Output (“dog”, total)
Several instances of mapper can run on different machines, and there can be another mapping
task for the key cat. The execution framework of MapReduce guarantees that all values
associated with the same key are brought together in the reducer via a shuffle stage.
As a result, the word count algorithm adds all counts associated with each key, which is
also a key–value pair. Thus, the basic framework of a MapReduce job can be summarized
as follows:
Map: 〈key, value〉→ list of 〈key, value〉
{This is the intermediate 〈key, value〉 pair}
Reduce: 〈key, list of values〉 → list of 〈key, value〉
In the earlier example, the output of the mapper for counting the occurrence of dog is
a list, 〈dog, 1〉, 〈dog, 1〉, 〈dog, 1〉…, and the output of the mapper for counting the occurrence
of cat is a list, 〈cat, 1〉, 〈cat, 1〉, 〈cat, 1〉…. The program will run across all files in a
directory. After the completion of the mapping phase, the intermediate 〈key, value〉 pairs
are exchanged between machines to send all values with the same key to a single reducer
(shuffling). The reducer produces an output 〈dog, 524〉, 〈cat, 316〉, 〈cow, 23〉…. Figure 2.8
illustrates this scheme.
It is important to realize that although MapReduce can be directly used for a large class
of problems that exhibit embarrassingly parallel feature, many algorithms cannot be easily
expressed as a single MapReduce job. Complex algorithms have to be decomposed into
a sequence of jobs, and data routing has to be orchestrated so that the output of one job
becomes the input to another job. These include iterative tasks that need to be repeated
before convergence is reached.
Interprocess Communication ◾ 39
2.9.3 Hadoop
In the world of cluster-level parallelism, libraries implementing message-passing interface
(MPI), or language extensions like OpenMP for shared memory parallelism, are well
known. These logical abstractions hide many details of synchronization and communications
at the process level. However, for a smooth implementation of such abstractions,
developers have to keep track of these aspects, as well as how resources are made available
to workers. This applies to MapReduce too. Apache Hadoop is an open-source implementation
of the infrastructure that MapReduce needs.
Hadoop uses the master–slave architecture. A master node (also called a NameNode)
receives the job from the user. The input data are broken into pieces and stored in the
Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). Physically, these data pieces are scattered over
a large number of nodes in the system. The master node assigns the components of the
job (map processes) to the various slave nodes (also called DataNodes). Each slave contributes
some local storage and computational power to solve the problem. When the
slave nodes complete their tasks, they return the results to the master. The master runs
the reduce process to aggregate the pieces and generate the result. If necessary, the slave
nodes may further subdivide the task and assign them to other slave nodes. Collectively,
such an implementation involves thousands of computing nodes and can handle petabytes
of data. DataNode failures are automatically handled in this framework. Hadoop
is written in Java.

2.10 MOBILE AGENTS
A different mode of communication between processes is possible via mobile agents.
A mobile agent is a piece of code that migrates from one machine to another. The code,
which is an executable program, is called a script. In addition, agents carry data values
or procedure arguments or interim states that need to be transported across machines.
The use of an interpretable language like Tcl makes it easy to support mobile agent–based
communication on heterogeneous platforms. Compared with messages that are passive,
agents are active and can be viewed as messengers. Agent migration is possible via the following
steps:
1. The sender writes the script and calls a procedure submit with the parameters (name,
parameters, target). The state of the agent and the parameters are marshaled and the
agent is sent to the target machine. The sender either blocks itself or continues with
an unrelated activity at its own site.
2. The agent reaches the destination, where an agent server handles it. The server authenticates
the agent, unmarshals its parameters, creates a separate process or thread, and
schedules it for the execution of the agent script.
3. When the script completes its execution, the server terminates the agent process,
marshals the state of the agent as well as the results of the computation if any, and
forwards it to the next destination, which can be a new machine, or the sender. The
choice of the next destination follows from the script.
Unlike an RPC that always returns to the sender, agents can follow a predefined
itinerary or make autonomous routing decisions. Such decisions are useful when the
next process to visit has crashed and the agent runs the risk of being trapped in a
black hole. Mobile agents thus overcome the limitations of the traditional client–server
architecture.
2.11 BASIC GROUP COMMUNICATION SERVICES
With the rapid growth of social networking and electronic commerce on the web, grouporiented
activities have substantially increased in recent years. Examples of groups are the
following:
• The batch of students graduating from a high school in a given year
• The friends of a person on Facebook or Twitter
• The clients of a video distribution service
• A set of replicated servers forming a highly available service
Interprocess Communication ◾ 41
Group communication services include (1) a membership service that maintains a
list of current members by keeping track of who joined the group, and which members
left the group (or crashed), and (2) various types of multicasts within the group.
Group members can use such multicasts as primitives for implementing different kinds
of services. One example is atomic multicast, which guarantees that regardless of failures,
either all nonfaulty members receive the message or no one receives the message.
Another example is an ordered multicast, where in addition to the atomicity property,
all nonfaulty members are required to receive the messages in a specific order. Each of
these multicasts has applications in the implementation of specific group services. We
will elaborate these in Chapter 15.
2.12 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The ISO model is a general framework for the development of network protocols. Real-life
protocol suites, however, do not always follow this rigid structure, but often, they can be
mapped into the ISO framework. TCP/IP is by far the most widely used networking protocol
today.
Middleware services help create an abstraction over the networking layers and relieve
users of many intricacies of network programming on wide area networks (WANs). Without
these services, the development of applications would have been slow and error prone. The
open nature of the request brokering services like CORBA adds to the interoperability of
the distributed applications. Future implementations will increase the efficiency of the services
with no need to rewrite the applications, as long as the interfaces remain unchanged.
2.13 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
An in-depth treatment of networking is available in Peterson and Davie’s book [PD96].
Gray’s book [G97] provides a detailed description of interprocess communication tools
in Unix. Needham’s article [N93] is a great introduction to naming. Albitz and Liu’s
book [AB01] describes the implementation of DNS. Birrell and Nelson [BN84] introduced
RPC. Several tutorials on Java RMI can be found in the Oracle’s website (Oracle
acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010). Waldo [W98] presented a comparison between
RPCs and RMIs. Arnold et al. [AOSW+99] described Jini (now called Apache River)
event service. Gray [G96] and subsequently Kotz et al. [KGNT+97] introduced agent Tcl.
The growth in web services and later cloud computing started with web 2.0 that includes
blogs and social networking sites. Since the late 1990s, network bandwidth witnessed
significant growth, and it opened up a window of opportunities. Salesforce.com led the
idea of delivering enterprise solutions via a website. In 2002, Amazon took it to the next
step by providing a suite of web services that makes storage and computation available
to users through their browsers. In 2006, Amazon’s EC2 enabled entrepreneurs to rent
computers as utilities and run their applications through browser-based interfaces. Dean
and Ghemawat [DG04] introduced MapReduce as a divide-and-conquer-based method
for tackling large data sets on clusters.

and explain how the following communications take place.
2.3 Two processes P and Q communicate with one another. P sends a sequence of characters
to Q. For each character sent by P, Q sends an ack back to P. When P receives the
ack, it sends the next character. Show an implementation of the earlier interprocess
communication using sockets.

the following distributed system using EC2: A writer process W writes a stream of
characters into a buffer of size 128, and a reader process R reads those characters
from the buffer. There are two constraints—the writer W should be blocked when the
buffer is full, and the reader R should be blocked when the buffer is empty. You can
assume that only one of the two processes is active at any time.

Models for Communication
3.1 NEED FOR A MODEL
A distributed computation involves a number of processes communicating with one
another. We observed in Chapter 2 that interprocess communication mechanism is fairly
complex. If we want to develop algorithms or build applications for a distributed system,
then the details of interprocess communication can be quite overwhelming. In general,
there are many dimensions of variability in distributed systems. These include network
topology, interprocess communication mechanisms, failure classes, and security mechanisms.
Models are simple abstractions that help understand the variability—abstractions
that preserve the essential features, but hide the implementation details from observers
who view the system at a higher level. Obviously, there can be many different models covering
many different aspects. For example, a network of static topology does not allow
the deletion or addition of nodes or links, but a dynamic topology allows such changes.
Depending on how models are implemented in the real world, results derived from an
abstract model can be applied to a wide range of platforms. Thus, a routing algorithm
developed on an abstract model can be applied to both ad hoc wireless LAN and sensor
network without much extra work. A model is acceptable, as long as its features or specifications
can be implemented, and these adequately reflect the events in the real world.
3.2 MESSAGE-PASSING MODEL FOR INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION
Interprocess communication is one dimension of variability in a distributed system. Two
primary models that capture the essence of interprocess communication are the messagepassing
model and the shared-memory model. In this section, we highlight the properties
of a message-passing model.
3.2.1 Process Actions
Represent a distributed system by a graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of nodes and E is a
set of edges joining pairs of nodes. Each node is a sequential process, and each edge corresponds
to a communication channel between a pair of processes. Unless otherwise stated,
we assume the graph to be directed—an edge from node i to node j will be represented by
the ordered pair (i, j). An undirected edge between a pair of processes i, j is equivalent to a
46 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
pair of directed edges, one from i to j and the other from j to i. The actions by a node can
be divided into the following four classes:
1. Internal action: An action is an internal action when a process performs computations in
its own address space resulting in the modification of one or more of its local variables.
2. Communication action: An action is a communication action when a process sends a
message to another process or receives a message from another process.
3. Input action: An action is an input action when a process reads data from sources
external to the system. For example, in a process control system, one or more processes
can input the values of environmental parameters monitored by sensors. These
data can potentially influence the operation of the system under consideration.
4. Output action: An action is an output action when it controls operations that are
external to the system. An example is the setting of a flag or raising an alarm. For a
given system, the part of the universe external to it is called its environment.
Messages propagate along directed edges called channels. Communications are assumed
to be point to point—a multicast is a set of point-to-point messages originating from a
designated sender process. Channels may be reliable or unreliable. In a reliable channel,
the loss or corruption of messages is ruled out. Unreliable channels will be considered in
Chapter 12. In the rest of this chapter, we assume reliable channels only.
3.2.2 Channels
The following axioms form a sample specification for a class of reliable channels:
Axiom 1
Every message sent by a sender is received by the receiver, and every message received by a
receiver is sent by some sender in the system.
Axiom 2
Each message has an arbitrary but finite, nonzero propagation delay.
Axiom 3
Each channel is a FIFO channel. Thus, if x and y are two messages sent by one process P to
another process Q and x is sent before y, then x is also received by Q before y.
We make no assumption about the upper bound of the propagation delay. Let c be a
channel (Figure 3.1) from process P to process Q, s(c) be the sequence of messages sent by
process P to process Q, and r(c) be the sequence of messages received by Q. Then it follows
from the earlier axioms that at any moment, r(c) is a prefix of s(c).
Models for Communication ◾ 47
The axioms presented earlier are true for our model only, but they may not be true for all
distributed systems. Some clarification about these axioms is given in the following. Axiom 1
rules out loss of messages as well as reception of spurious messages. When channels are
unreliable, Axiom 1 may be violated at the data link or the transport layer. Recovery of lost
messages is an important aspect of link and transport layer protocols.
In Axiom 2, the absence of a predefined upper bound for the propagation delay is an
important characteristic of asynchronous channels. It also weakens the computational
model. In reality, depending on the nature of the channel and the distance between the
sender and the receiver, it is sometimes possible to specify an upper bound on the propagation
delay. For example, consider a system housed inside a small room, and let signals
directly propagate along electrical wires from one process to another. Since electrical signals
travel approximately 1 ft/ns, the propagation delay across a 20 ft link inside the room
will apparently barely exceed 20 ns.* However, if the correct operation of a system depends
on the upper bound of the propagation delay, then the correctness of the same system may
be jeopardized when the length of the link is increased to 300 ft. The advantage of weakening
the model is that a system designed for channels with arbitrarily large but finite delay
continues to behave correctly regardless of the actual value of the propagation delay. Delay
insensitivity thus adds to the robustness and the universal applicability of the system.
Axiom 3 is not necessarily satisfied by a datagram service—packets may arrive out of
order at the receiving end. In order that our model becomes applicable, it is necessary to
assume the existence of a layer of service that resequences the packets before these are
delivered to the receiver process. We want to carefully separate the intrinsic properties of
our model from its implementation in an actual application environment.
How many messages can a channel hold? There are two possible ways to abstract this: the
capacity of a channel may be either an infinite or finite. With a channel of infinite capacity,
the sender process can send messages as frequently as it wants—the channel is never
blocked (or it never drops messages due to storage limitations) regardless of the slowness of
the receiver process. With a finite-capacity channel, however, the channel may sometimes be
* In most cases of interprocess communication, the major part of the delay is not due to the propagation time along the
wire, but due to the handling of the send and the receive operations by the various layers of the network protocols, as well
as delay caused by the routers.

full, and attempts to send messages may either block the sender or return an error message
or cause messages to be dropped. Although any real channel has a finite capacity, this capacity
may often be so large that the sender is rarely affected. From this perspective, arbitrarily
large capacity of channels is a useful simplification, and not an unreasonable abstraction.
A channel is an interesting type of shared data object. It differs from a memory cell in many
ways. For example, it is not possible to write anything (in the sense that a traditional write
operation erases the old contents of a memory cell) into the channel—one can only append
something to the existing contents of the channel. An immediate consequence of this limitation
is that it is not possible to unsend a message that has already been sent along a channel.
Similarly, one cannot read the contents (traditional reads are nondestructive) of a channel—one
can only read and delete the header element from a channel. Other than append and delete, it is
tempting to assume the existence of a Boolean function empty(c) that returns true if channel c
is empty. However, it is far from trivial to determine if a channel is empty at a given moment.
3.2.3 Synchronous versus Asynchronous Systems
Another dimension of variability in distributed systems is synchrony and asynchrony. The
broad notion of synchrony is based on senders and receivers maintaining synchronized clocks
and executing actions with a rigid temporal relationship. However, a closer view reveals many
aspects of synchrony, and the transition from a fully asynchronous to a fully synchronous model
is a gradual one. Some of the behaviors characterizing a synchronous system are as follows:
Synchronous clocks: In a system with synchronous clocks, the local clocks of every processor
show the same time. The readings of a set of independent clocks tend to drift, and the difference
grows over time. Even with atomic clocks, drifts are possible, although the extent of this drift
is much smaller than that between clocks designed with ordinary electrical components. For
less stringent applications, the domestic power supply companies closely mimic this standard,
where a second is equal to the time for 60 oscillations of the alternating voltage (or 50 oscillations
according to the European standard and also in Australian and Asian countries) entering
our premises.* Since clocks can never be perfectly synchronized, a weaker notion of synchronized
clocks is that the drift rate of local clocks from real time has a known upper bound.
Synchronous processes: A system of synchronous processes takes actions in lockstep synchrony,
that is, in each step, all processes execute an eligible action. In real life, however,
every process running on a processor frequently stumbles because of interrupts. As a result,
interrupt service routines introduce arbitrary amounts of delay between the executions of
two consecutive instructions, making it appear to the outside world as if instruction execution
speeds are unpredictable with no obvious lower bound. Using a somewhat different
characterization, a process is sometimes called synchronous, when there is a known lower
bound of its instruction execution speed.
Even when processes are asynchronous, computations sometimes progress in phases or
in rounds—in each phase or round, every process does a predefined amount of work, and
no process starts the (i + 1)th phase until all processes have completed their ith phases.
* These clock pulses are used to drive many of our older desktop and wall clocks, but now, it is obsolete.
Models for Communication ◾ 49
The implementation of such a phase-synchronous or round-synchronous behavior requires
the use of an appropriate phase synchronization protocol.
Synchronous channels: A channel is called synchronous when there is a known upper
bound on the message propagation delay along that channel. Such channels are also known
as bounded-delay channels.
Synchronous message order: The message order is synchronous when the receiver process
receives messages in the same order in which sender process sent them (Axiom 3 in
Section 3.2.2 satisfies this).
Synchronous communication: In synchronous communication, a sender sends a message
only when the receiver is ready to receive it and vice versa. When the communication is
asynchronous, there is no coordination between the sender and the receiver. The sender of
message number i does not care whether the previous message (i − 1) sent by it has already
been received. This type of send operation is also known as a nonblocking send operation.
In a blocking send, a message is sent only when the receiver signals its readiness to receive
the message. Like send, receive operations can also be blocking or nonblocking. In blocking
receive, a process waits indefinitely long to receive a message that it is expecting from a
sender. If the receive operation is nonblocking, then a process moves to the next task in case
the expected message does not (yet) arrive and attempts to receive it later.
Synchronous communication involves a form of handshaking between the sender
and the receiver processes. In real life, postal or email communication is a form of
asynchronous communication, whereas a telephone conversation is a great example
of a synchronous communication.
In [H78], Tony Hoare introduced the communicating sequential process (CSP) model—it
adopts a version of synchronous communication, where a pair of neighboring processes communicates
through a channel of zero capacity. A sender process P executes an instruction Q!x
to output the value of its local variable x to the receiver process Q. The receiver process Q executes
the instruction P?y to receive the value from P and assign it to its local variable y. The
execution of the instructions Q!x and P?y is synchronized, inasmuch as the execution of anyone
of these two is blocked, until the other process is ready to execute the other instruction. More
recent examples of synchronous communication are Ada rendezvous, RPCs [BN84], and RMI.
Note that of these five features, our message-passing model introduced at the beginning
of this chapter assumed synchronous message order only.
3.2.4 Real-Time Systems
Real-time systems form a special class of distributed systems that are required to respond
to inputs in a timely and predictable way. Timeliness is a crucial issue here, and usually,
the cost of missing deadlines is high. Depending on the seriousness of the deadline, realtime
systems are classified as hard or soft. The air-traffic control system is an example of
a hard real-time system where missed deadlines are likely to cost human lives. A vending
machine is an example of a soft real-time system, where a delay in receiving an item after
inserting the proper amount in coins can cause some annoyance to the customer, but nothing
serious will happen.

3.3 SHARED VARIABLES
In the message-passing model, each process has a private address space. In an alternative model
of computation, the address spaces of subsets of processes overlap, and the overlapped portion
of the address space is used for interprocess communication. This model is known as the sharedmemory
model. The shared-memory model has a natural implementation on tightly coupled
multiprocessors. Traditionally, concurrent operations on shared variables are serialized, and
the correctness of many shared-memory algorithms relies on this serialization property.
There are important and subtle differences between the message-passing and the sharedmemory
models of computation. One difference is that in a shared-memory model, a single
copy of a variable or a program code is shared by more than one process, whereas to share
that variable in the message-passing model, each process must have an exclusive copy of it.
Consequently, consistent serialization of updates is a nontrivial task.
Due to the popularity of shared variables, many computing clusters support DSM, an
abstraction for sharing a virtual address space between computers that do not share physical
memory. The underlying hardware is a multicomputer, and the computers communicate
with one another using message passing. The primary utility of DSM is to relieve the
users of the intricate details of message passing and let them use the richer programming
tools of parallel programming available for shared-memory systems.
Two variations of the shared-memory model used in distributed algorithms are (1) the
state-reading model (also known as the locally shared variable model) and (2) the link register
model. In the state-reading model, any process can read, in addition to its own state,
the state of each of its neighbors from which a channel is incident on it. However, such a
process can update only its own state. Figure 3.2a illustrates the state-reading model, where
processes 1 and 3 can read the state of process 2 and process 0 can read the state of process 1.
In the link register model, each link or channel is a single-reader single-writer register
(Figure 3.2b). The sender writes into this register, and the receiver reads from that register.
To avoid additional complications, the link register model also assumes that all read and
write operations on a link register are serialized, that is, write operations never overlap
with read operations.* A bidirectional link (represented by an undirected edge) consists of
a pair of link registers.
* The behavior of registers under overlapping read or write operations is beyond the scope of this chapter.

respectively, which are updated by 2. The contents of these registers are limited by how much 2
wants to share with them.
Models for Communication ◾ 51
One difference between the earlier two models is that in Figure 3.2b, neighbors
1 and 3 access the information from the link registers R21 and R23, respectively, and
their contents are limited by how much process 2 wants to share with them. These may
be different from the state of process 1. It also depends on when these register values
are updated.
3.3.1 Linda
David Gelernter at Yale University developed Linda in 1985 [G85]. It is a concurrent programming
model using the concept of a shared tuple space, which is essentially a shared
communication mechanism. The general principle is similar to blackboard systems used
in artificial intelligence. Processes collaborate, by depositing and withdrawing tuples.
Processes may not know each other or at least they do not directly communicate with
each other. Communication is based on pattern matching, that is, a process may check
for a needed tuple very much like the query-by-example paradigm in database systems
and retrieve one or more tuples that satisfy the pattern. Depositing tuples is asynchronous,
while a querying process may choose to block itself until such time when a tuple
is matched.
Linda tuples are unordered and accessed by six primitives. The primitive OUT and IN
are used to deposit a tuple into the tuple space and extract a tuple from the tuple space—
these simulate the send and the receive operations, respectively. The primitive RD also
receives a tuple, but unlike IN, it does not delete the tuple from the space. INP and RDP are
nonblocking versions of IN and RD—these work like IN and RD when there are matching
tuples, but return a false otherwise.
Finally, EVAL creates new processes and can be compared
with the Unix fork command.
The following is an example of a Linda program written as an extension of a C program.
A master process delegates tasks to n slave processes. When all slaves finish their tasks,
they output “done” into the tuple space. The master inputs this from the tuple space and
then prints a message that all tasks have been completed.
/** main program**/
real_main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
int nslave, j, hello();
nslave = atoi (argv[1]);
for (j = 0; j < nslave; j++)
EVAL (“slave”, hello(j));
for(j = 0; j < nslave; j++)
IN(“done”);
printf(“Task completed.\n”);
}
52 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
/** subroutine hello **/
int hello (i)
int i;
{
printf(“Task from number %d.\n”,i);
OUT(“done”);
return(0);
}
JavaSpace is an object coordination system that is based on Linda. Tuple space can be
implemented as a distributed data structures, and parts of the space can be physically
mapped on the local memory of the different processes in a network. Further details can
be found in [CG89].
3.4 MODELING MOBILE AGENTS
A mobile agent is a program code that migrates from one process to another. Unlike a
message that is passive, a mobile agent is an active entity that can be compared with a
messenger. The agent code is executed at the host machine where the agent can interact
with the variables of programs running on the host machine, use its resources, and take
autonomous routing decisions. During migration, the process in execution transports its
state from one machine to another while keeping its data intact. Two major categories
of mobile agents are in use: some support strong mobility, and others don’t. With strong
mobility, agents are able to transfer its control state from one machine to another—thus
after executing instruction k in a machine A, the mobile agent can execute instruction
(k + 1) in the next machine B. With weak mobility, the control state is not transferred—so
at each host, the code executes without this information.
Mobile agents complement the existing technologies of interprocess communication.
In applications involving very large databases, network bandwidth can be saved when a
client sends a mobile agent to the database server with a few queries, instead of pulling huge
volumes of data from the server to the client site. Mobile agents also facilitate disconnected
modes of operation. Messages and mobile agents can coexist: while certain tasks use message
passing, a mobile agent can carry out the task of coordinating an activity across the
entire network or in a fraction of it. Dartmouth’s D’Agents and IBM’s Aglets are two wellknown
mobile agent systems.
A mobile agent with weak mobility can be modeled as follows: call the initiator of the
agent its home. Each mobile agent is designated by (at least) three components (I, P, B).
The first component I is the agent identifier and is unique for every agent. The second
component P designates the agent program that is executed at every process visited
by it. The third component B is the briefcase and represents the data variables to be
used by the agent. Two additional variables current and next keep track of the current
location of the agent and the next process to visit. Here is an example of a computation
using mobile agents: Consider the task of computing the lowest price of an item that is
Models for Communication ◾ 53
being sold in n different stores. Let price(i) denote the price of the item in store i, and let
the briefcase variable best denote the lowest price of the item among the stores visited
by the agent so far. Treat each store as a process. To compute best, an initiator process
sends a mobile agent to a neighboring process. Thereafter, the agent executes the following
program P at each site before returning home:
initially current = home; best = price(home),
visit next; {next depends on a traversal algorithm}
{after reaching a new host}
while current ≠ home do
if price(i) < best then best := price(i) else skip end if;
visit next;
end while
It will take another traversal to disseminate the value of best among all the processes.
Readers may compare the complexity of this solution with the corresponding solutions on
the message-passing or the shared-memory model.
Agents can be itinerant or autonomous. In the itinerant agent model, the initiator loads
the agent with a fixed itinerary that the agent is supposed to follow. For an autonomous
agent, there is no fixed itinerary—at each step, the agent is required to determine which
process it should visit next to get the job done.
In network management, a class of primitive agents mimicking biological entities
like ants has been used to solve problems like shortest path computation and congestion
control. The individual agents do not have any explicit problem-solving knowledge, but
intelligent action emerges from the collective action by ants. White [WP98] describes the
operation of ant-based algorithms.
3.5 RELATIONSHIP AMONG MODELS
While all models discussed so far are related to interprocess communication only,
other models deal with other dimensions of variability. For example, failure models
abstract the behavior of faulty processes and are discussed in Chapter 13. Models are
important to programmers and algorithm designers. Before devising the solution to
a problem, it is important to know the rules of the game. Two models A and B are
equivalent, when there exists a 1-1 correspondence between the objects and operations
of A and those of B.
3.5.1 Strong and Weak Models
Informally, one model A is considered stronger than another model B, when to implement
an object (or operation) in A, one requires more than one object (or operation) in B. For
example, a model that supports multicast is stronger than a model that supports point-topoint
communications, since ordinarily a single multicast is implemented using several
54 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
point-to-point communications.* The term stronger is also attributed to a model that has
more constraints compared to those in another model (called the weaker model). In this
sense, message-passing
models with bounded-delay channels are stronger than messagepassing
models with unbounded-delay channels. Using this view, synchronous models are
stronger than asynchronous models. Remember that strong and weak are not absolute, but
relative attributes, and there is no measure to quantify them. It is also true that sometimes
two models cannot be objectively compared, so one cannot be branded as stronger than
the other.
Which model would you adopt for designing a distributed application? There is no unique
answer to this question. On one side, the choice of a strong model simplifies algorithm
design, since many constraints relevant to the application are built into the model. This
simplifies correctness proofs too. On the other side, when an application is implemented,
a crucial issue is the support provided by the underlying hardware and the operating system.
Occasionally, you may want to port an available solution from an alternate model to
a target platform—for example, an elegant leader election algorithm running on the link
register model is described in a textbook, and you may want to implement it on a messagepassing
architecture with bounded process delays and bounded channel capacities, because
that is what the hardware architecture of the target platform supports. This may add to the
complexity.
Such implementations are exercises in simulation and are of interest not only to practitioners
but also to theoreticians. Can model A be simulated using model B? What are
the time and space complexities of such simulations? Questions like these are intellectually
challenging and stimulating, and building such layers of abstraction has been one of
the major activities of computer scientists. In general, it is simpler to implement a weaker
model from a stronger one, but the implementation of a stronger model using a weaker one
may take considerable effort. In the remainder of this section, we outline a few such
implementations.
3.5.2 Implementing a FIFO Channel Using a Non-FIFO Channel
Let c be a non-FIFO channel from process P to process Q. Assume that the message delay
along c is arbitrary but finite. Consider a sequence of messages m[0], m[1], m[2], …, m[k]
sent by process P. Here, i denotes the sequence number of the message m[i]. Since the channel
is not FIFO, it is possible for m[j] to reach Q after m[i] even if i > j. To simulate FIFO
behavior, process Q operates in two phases: store and deliver. The roles of these phases are
explained as follows:
Store: Whenever Q receives a message m[j], it stores it in its local buffer.
Deliver: Process Q delivers the message to the application, only after message m[j − 1] has
already been delivered.
* The claim becomes debatable for those systems where physical system supports broadcasts.
Models for Communication ◾ 55
The implementation, referred to as a resequencing protocol, is described in the following.
It assumes that every message has a sequence number that grows monotonically.
{Sender process P} {Receiver process Q}
var i : integer {initially 0} var k : integer {initially 0}
buffer : buffer [0..∞] of
message
repeat {initially for all k:
buffer[k] = null}
send m[i],i to Q; repeat {store}
i := i+1; receive m[i],i from P;
forever store m[i] into buffer[i];
{deliver}
while buffer[k] ≠ null do
begin
deliver the content of
buffer k];
buffer [k] := null; k := k+1;
end
forever
The solution is somewhat simplistic for two reasons: (1) the sequence numbers can become
arbitrarily large, making it impossible to fit in a packet of bounded size, and (2) the size of
the buffer required at the receiving end has to be arbitrarily large.
Now, change the model. Assume that there exists a known upper bound of T seconds
on the message propagation delay along channel c, and messages are sent out at a uniform
rate of r messages per second by process P. It is easy to observe that the receiving process Q
will not need a buffer of size larger than r · T, and it is feasible to use a sequence number of
bounded size from the range [0.. r · T). Synchrony helps! Of course, this requires process Q
to receive the messages at a rate faster than r.
How can we implement the resequencing protocol with bounded sequence numbers on
a system with unbounded message propagation delay? A simple solution is to use acks. Let
the receiving process have a buffer of size w to store all messages that have been received,
but not yet been delivered. The sender will send messages m[0], m[1], …, m[w − 1] and wait
for an ack from the receiver. The receiver will empty the buffer and deliver them to the
application and send an ack to the sender. Thereafter, the sender can recycle the sequence
numbers 0..(w − 1).
The price paid for saving the buffer space is a reduction in the message throughput
rate. The exact throughput will depend on the value of w, as well as the time elapsed
between the sending of m[w − 1] and the receipt of the ack. The larger is the value
of w, the bigger is the buffer size, the fewer is the number of acks, and the better is the
throughput.
56 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
3.5.3 Implementing Message Passing Using Shared Memory
A relatively easy task is to implement message passing on a shared-memory
multiprocessor.
Such a simulation must satisfy the channel axioms. The implementation
of a channel of capacity (max − 1) between a pair of processes uses a circular message
buffer of size max (Figure 3.3).
Let s[i] denote the ith message sent by the sender and r[j] denote the jth message
received by the receiver. The implementation is described in the following. Observe that
the sender is blocked when the channel is full and the receiver is blocked when the channel
is empty.
shared var p, q: integer {initially p = q}
buffer: array [0..max-1] of message
{Sender process P}
var s: array of messages sent by P, i : integer {initially 0}
repeat
if p ≠ q − 1 mod max then
begin
buffer[p] := s[i]; i := i + 1; p := p + 1 mod max
end
forever
{Receiver process Q}
var r: array of messages received by Q, j : integer {initially 0}
repeat
if q ≠ p mod max then
begin
r[j] := buffer[q]; j := j + 1; q := q + 1 mod max
end
forever
3.5.4 Implementing Shared Memory Using Message Passing
We now look into the implementation of a globally shared variable X in a system of n processes
0, 1, 2, …, n − 1 using message passing. For this, each process i maintains a local

Models for Communication ◾ 57
copy x[i] of X (Figure 3.4). The important requirement here is that whenever a process
wants to read X, its local copy must equal the latest updated value of X. A first step towards
implementing the read and write operations on X is described as follows:
{Implementing shared memory by message passing: first attempt}
{read X by process i}
read x[i] x[i] := v
{write X := v by process i}
x[i] := v
Multicast v to every other process j (j ≠ i) in the system;
Process j (j ≠ i), after receiving the multicast, sets x[j] to v.
The apparent goal is to make each local copy of the shared variable identical to one another
after each update operation. However, there are problems. Assume that two processes
0
and 1 are trying to update the shared variable X simultaneously with different values. It is
possible for these updates to reach processes 2 and 3 in different order, making x[2] ≠ x[3].
It may appear that the problem can be resolved by making the multicast operation write
X an indivisible operation (also known as an atomic operation), but actually, it does not
resolve the problem, since it does not regulate the order of arrival of the updates at their
destination processes. Thus, the solution described here is simplistic, flawed, and incomplete.
Furthermore, implementing an atomic operation is far from trivial and has its own
overhead.* What is needed is a guarantee that all processes will always receive the updates
in identical order. This is known as total order multicast. Its implementation depends on
how multicasts are performed and whether messages can be lost and whether processes
are prone to failures. We will address the feasibility of this in Chapter 16.
* Implementation of atomic broadcasts will be addressed in Chapter 16.

3.5.5 Impossibility Result with Channels
Let us revisit the message-passing model and examine the problem of detecting whether
a channel is empty. A familiar scenario is as follows: there are two processes i and j and
two channels (i, j) and (j, i). During a cold start, these channels may contain an arbitrary
sequence of messages. To properly initialize the channel, process j, before starting the execution
of a program, wants to make sure that the channel (i, j) is empty, so that whatever
message it receives was actually sent by process i. How can process j detect this condition?
If the clocks are synchronized and there exists an upper bound T on the message
propagation delay along channel (i, j), then the problem is simple—both processes i and
j pause for at least T seconds—this flushes both channels and each process rejects all the
messages arriving during this time. After T seconds, process j knows that channel (i, j)
is empty.
What if there is no known upper bound on the channel propagation delay? It is impossible
for process j to wait for a bounded time and declare that channel (i, j) is empty. An
alternative attempt is for process j to send a message to process i, requesting it to echo back
the special message * along channel (i, j). If the channel is FIFO and process j receives the
special message * before receiving any other message, then j might be tempted to conclude
that the channel must have been empty. However, there is a fly in the ointment—it assumes
that initially the channel (i, j) did not contain the special message *. This contradicts the
assumption that initially the channel can contain arbitrary messages.
Although this is not a formal impossibility proof, it turns out that without an upper
bound on the message propagation delay, it is not possible to detect whether a channel is
empty even if it is known to be FIFO.
3.6 CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SPECIAL PROPERTIES
Distributed systems are also sometimes classified based on special properties or special
features. Here are a few classifications.
3.6.1 Reactive versus Transformational Systems
A distributed system is called reactive when one or more processes constantly react to
environmental
changes or user requests. An example of a reactive system is a server.
Ordinarily, the servers never sleep—whenever client processes send out requests for service,
the servers provide the desired service. Another example of a reactive system is a
token ring network. A process requesting service waits to grab the token and, after completing
the send or receive operation, releases the token that is eventually passed on to
another waiting process. This goes on forever.
The goal of nonreactive systems is to transform the initial state into a final state
via actions of the component processes and reach a terminal point. An example is the
computation
of the routing table in a network of processes. When the computation terminates,
or reaches a fixed point, every process has its routing table correctly configured.
Unless there is a failure or a change in topology, there is no need to recompute the routing
tables. Nonreactive systems are also known as transformational systems.
Models for Communication ◾ 59
3.6.2 Named versus Anonymous Systems
A distributed system is called anonymous when the algorithms do not take into consideration
the names or the identifiers of the processes. Otherwise, it is a named system. Most
real systems are named systems. However, anonymity is an esthetically pleasing property
that allows a computation to run unhindered even when the processes change their names
or a newly created process takes up the task of an old process. From the space complexity
point of view, each process needs at least log2n bits to store its name where n is the number
of processes. This becomes unnecessary in anonymous systems.
Anonymous systems pose a different kind of challenge to algorithm designers. Without
identifiers or names, processes become indistinguishable. This symmetry creates problems
for those applications in which the outcome is required to be asymmetric. As an
example, consider the task of electing a leader in a network of n (n > 1) processes. Since
by definition there can be only one leader, the outcome is clearly asymmetric. However,
since every process will start from the same initial state and will execute identical instructions
at every step, there is no obvious guarantee that the outcome will be asymmetric, at
least using deterministic means. In such cases, probabilistic techniques become useful for
breaking symmetry.
3.7 COMPLEXITY MEASURES
The cost or complexity of a distributed algorithm depends on the algorithm, as well as on
the model. Two well-known measures of complexity are the space complexity (per process)
and the time complexity.
The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory space required to solve
an instance of the algorithm as a function of the size of the system. One may wonder if we
should care about space complexity, when the cost of memory has come down drastically.
In the context of present-day technology, the absolute measure may not be very significant
for most applications, but the scale of growth as a function of the number of nodes in
the network (or the diameter of the network) may be a significant issue. A constant space
complexity, as represented by O(1) using the big-O notation, is clearly the best, since the
space requirement for each process is immune to network growth. Also, many applications
require processes to send the value of their current state to remote processes. The benefit of
constant space is that message sizes remain unchanged regardless of the size or the topology
of the network.
For time complexity, numerous measures are available. Some of these measures evolved
from the fuzzy notion of time across the entire system, as well as the nondeterministic
nature of distributed computations. An accepted metric is the total number of steps needed
by all the processes in the worst case from start to end, each step accounting for a basic
action. The execution of an algorithm may halt from time to time due to interruptions
generated by the operating systems, but the time complexity measure is immune to these
unpredictable interruptions.
With today’s technology, processor clocks tick at rates greater than 1 GHz, but message
propagation delays still range from a few microseconds to a few milliseconds.
60 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Communication cost is the major overhead of the time needed to execute a distributed
algorithm. Accordingly, a more relevant metric is the message complexity, which is the
number of messages exchanged during an instance of the algorithm as a function of the
size of the system. Message complexity fills the void left in the traditional measure of time
complexity.
An argument against the use of the number of messages as a fair measure of message
complexity is as follows. Messages do not have constant sizes—the size of a message may
range from 64 or 128 bits to several million bits. If message sizes are taken into account,
then sometimes the cost of sending a large number of short messages can be lower than the
cost of sending a much smaller number of large messages. This suggests that the total number
of bits exchanged (i.e., the bit complexity) during the execution of an algorithm should
be a more appropriate measure of the communication cost. Another form of classification
in message complexity is based on the LOCAL and the CONGEST models [Peleg00]. The
LOCAL model is simplistic—it disregards the size of the messages (and the variability in
the time needed to process them) and assumes that all enabled processes execute their
actions simultaneously. The CONGEST model takes into account the volume of communication
and enforces a limit of O(log n) on the basic message size, where n is the size of
the system. The CONGEST model however allows process actions to be synchronous or
asynchronous.
In a purely asynchronous message-passing model with arbitrary message propagation
delays, absolute time plays no role. However, in models with bounded channel delays and
approximately synchronized clocks, a useful alternative metric is the total time required
to execute an instance of the algorithm. One can separately estimate the average and the
worst-case complexities.
The shared-memory models handle shared communication costs in a simplistic way.
The program of each process is a sequence of discrete steps that include the communication
overhead via reading of the state variables of a neighboring process (thus, it requires
one step to read the state of a neighboring process). The size or grain of these discrete steps
is called the atomicity of the computation, and the entire computation is an interleaving of
the sequence of atomic steps. The time complexity of an algorithm is the total number of
steps taken by all the processes during its execution as a function of the size of the system.
As with space complexity, here also, the key issue is the growth of time complexity with the
growth in network size or the network diameter.
Example 3.1: Multicasting in a Hypercube
Consider a k-cube with n = 2k processes. Each vertex represents a process and each
edge represents a bidirectional FIFO channel. Process 0 is the initiator of a multicast—
it periodically multicasts a value that updates a local variable x in each process in
the n-cube. Let x[i] denote the value of x in process i. The initial values of x[i] can be
arbitrary. The case of k = 3 is illustrated in Figure 3.5.
Models for Communication ◾ 61
Let N(i) denote the set of neighbors of process i. Process 0 starts the multicast by
sending the value to each node in N(0). Thereafter, every process i executes the following
program:
{Program for process i > 0}
receive message m {m contains the value};
if m is received for the first time
then x[i] := m.value;
send x[j] to each node in {j ∈ N(i): j > i}
else discard m
end if
The multicast terminates when every process j has received a message from each
neighbor i < j and sent a message to every neighbor k > j (whenever there exists one).
Since messages traverse every edge exactly once, the message complexity of
the proposed algorithm is |E|, where E is the set of edges. It is easy to observe that
|E| = (1/2)n ⋅ log2n.
Example 3.2
We now solve the same problem on the state-reading model, where each process can
read the states of all of its neighbors. As before, processes start from an arbitrary initial
state. Process 0 first executes x[0] := v (where v is the value to be multicast), and thereafter,
process 0 remains idle. Every other process executes the following program:
{Program for process i>0}
while ∃j ∈ N(i): (j < i) ∧ (x(i) ≠ x(j)) do x(i) := x(j) end while
When the multicast is complete, ∀i, j: x(i) = x(j).
In the state-reading model, the sender is passive—it is the receiver’s responsibility
to pull the appropriate value from the sender (as opposed to pushing the value in

the message-passing model). Accordingly, when a process pulls a different value of
x from a lower-numbered process, it has no way of knowing if it is the value chosen
by the source or it is the unknown initial value of that node. The time complexity,
as measured by the maximum number of assignment statements executed by all the
processes, can be arbitrarily large. To understand why, assume that in Figure 3.5, the
initial states of the nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 are different from one another. Here, node 7
may continue to copy the states of these three neighbors one after another for an
indefinitely long period. However, eventually, nodes 3, 5, 6 will set their states to that
of node 0, and after this, node 7 will require one more step to set x[7] to the value
multicast from node 0. This is why the upper bound of the time complexity is finite,
but arbitrarily large.
If however the initial values of x[i] are not arbitrary (which is the case after the
first multicast is over), then the message complexity will be the same as that in the
message-passing model. Even when the initial values of x are arbitrary, we can devise
an alternative solution with bounded time complexity as follows: Allocate an additional
buffer space of size log n per process, and ask every process to read and memorize
the states of all of its neighbors that have a lower id before modifying its own
state. A process will update its state only when the states of all of its lower-numbered
neighbors are identical and it is different from its own state. The modified rule for
process i will be as follows:
while ∀j, k ∈ N(i): j < i ∧ k < i, x(j) = x(k) ∧ x[i] ≠ x[j]
do x(i) := x(j) end while
The multicast terminates when the predicate is false for all processes. In a k-cube,
the maximum number of steps required by all the processes to complete the multicast
can be calculated as follows. We focus on the maximum number of steps needed
by the process that is farthest from the source to acquire the value from the source,
since it is easy to argue that by that time, the multicast will reach all other processes.
After one step, the process that is farthest from process 0 (i.e., at distance k) copies
the state of its distance-1 neighbors; after an additional (kC1 ) +1 steps, it copies
the state of its distance-2 neighbors; after an additional (kC2 kC1 ) + +1 steps, it copies
the state of its distance-3 neighbors; and so on. The total number of steps to complete
the multicast is the sum of all these. Since the number of steps required to copy
a value from the farthest process is kCk kCk kC kC ( + + + + + ) −1 2 1  1 ≤ 2k, and the time
to copy the value from any interim distance is bounded by this upper limit, the maximum
number of steps needed to complete the multicast is ≤k ⋅ 2k, that is, O(n logn).
Round complexity: Another measure of time complexity in asynchronous systems
is
based on rounds. Historically, a round involves synchronous processes that execute
their actions in lockstep synchrony, and round complexity is the number of steps
taken by each process as a function of the size of the input. In asynchronous systems, a
round is an execution sequence in which the slowest
enabled process executes one step.
Models for Communication ◾ 63
Naturally, during this period, the faster processes may have taken one or more steps. Thus,
the following execution in a system of four processes 0, 1, 2, 3 constitutes two rounds:
1 2 0 2 1 3 2 1 0 1 3
The notion of rounds gives us a measure of the number of steps that will be necessary,
if processes execute their actions in lockstep synchrony. The algorithm in the
modified version of Example 2 will take log2n rounds to complete, log2n being the
diameter of the network.
The examples illustrated here use deterministic actions only. There is a rich set of
algorithms in distributed computing that uses probabilistic or randomized actions,
where the next state of a process or the choice of a neighbor is decided using a coin
flip. Since the time complexity can vary from one run to another, the time complexity
in such cases is determined either by the expected number of steps or by the number
of required steps with high probability (abbreviated as w.h.p.), which is synonymous
with the probability  (1−(1 n )) c , where c > 1. We will study a couple of probabilistic
algorithms in Chapter 10.
3.8 CONCLUDING REMARKS
A model is an abstraction of a real system. When the real system is complex, reasoning about
correctness becomes complicated. In such cases, various mechanisms of abstraction are used to
hide certain details irrelevant to the main issues. Weaker models have fewer constraints. Systems
functioning correctly on weaker models usually function correctly on stronger models without
additional work, but the converse is not true. This chapter presents a partial view—it only focuses
on some of the broader features of the various models, but ignores more difficult and subtle issues
related to scheduling of actions or grains of computation. These will be addressed in Chapter 5
where we discuss program correctness. The implementation of one kind of model using another
kind of model is intellectually challenging, particularly when we explore the limits of space and
time complexities. Results related to impossibilities, upper and lower bounds of space, time, or
message requirements, form the foundations of the theory of distributed computing.
3.9 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Brinch Hansen’s RC4000 operating system [BH73] is one of the first practical systems based
on the message-passing model. The original nucleus supported four primitives to enable
client–server communication using a shared pool of buffers. Cynthia Dwork first presented
the taxonomy of synchronous behavior. In a classic paper (CSPs), Hoare introduced synchronous
message passing [H78] as a form of communication via handshaking. David May
of INMOS implemented it in Occam [M83]. Other well-known examples of this model are
Ada Rendezvous and RPC. David Gelernter [G85] developed Linda. Since then, the Linda
primitives have been added to several languages like C or FORTRAN. Two prominent and
contemporary uses of message passing are MPI (introduced in the MPI forum in 1994—
see the article by Marc Snir et al. [DOSW96]) and parallel virtual machine (PVM) by Geist
et al. [GBDW+94]. Various middlewares introduced in Chapter 2 highlight the importance
64 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
of the message-passing model. Two well-known tools for mobile agent implementations
are Dartmouth’s D’Agent [GKC+98] and IBM’s Aglets [LO98], and various abstraction of
mobile agents can be found in [AAKK+00] and [G00].
Shared variables have received attention from the early days of multiprocessors and have
been extensively studied in the context of various synchronization primitives. In the modern
context, the importance of shared variables lies in the fact that many programming
languages favor the shared variable abstraction regardless of how they are implemented.
DSM creates the illusion of shared memory on an arbitrary multicomputer substrate. In
client–server computing, clients and servers communicate with one another using messages,
but interclient communication uses shared objects maintained by the server.
For discussions on algorithmic complexities, read the classic book by Cormen et al.
[CLR+01]. The LOCAL and the CONGEST models were introduced by Peleg [Peleg00].
EXERCISES
3.1 Distinguish between the link register model and the message-passing model in which
each channel has unit capacity. Implement the link register model using the messagepassing
model.
3.2 A keyboard process K sends an arbitrarily large stream of key codes to a process P,
which is supposed to store them in its local memory. In addition to receiving the inputs
from K, P also executes an infinite computation. The channel (K, P) has a finite capacity.
Explain how K and P will communicate with each other in the following two cases:
a. K uses blocking send, and P uses nonblocking receive.
b. K uses blocking send, and P uses blocking receive.
Comment on the progress of the computation in each case.
3.3 The CSP language proposed by Hoare [H78] uses a form of synchronous message passing:
a process sending a message is delayed or blocked until the receiver is ready to
receive the message, and vice versa. The symbols ! and ? are used to designate output
and input actions, respectively. To send a value e to a process Q, the sending process
P executes the statement Q!e, and to receive this value from P and assign it to a local
variable x, process Q executes the action P?x. Write a program with three processes P,
Q, and move, so that process move receives the values of an array x of known size from
P one after another and sends them to Q, which assigns these values to a local array y.
3.4 n client processes 0..(n − 1) share a resource managed by a resource server. The
resources are to be used in a mutually exclusive manner. The clients send requests for
using these resources, and the server guarantees to allocate the resource to the clients
in a fair manner (you are free to invent your own notion of fairness here and try different
definitions), and the clients guarantee to return the resources in a finite time.
Write down a program to illustrate the client–server communication using (a)
message
passing and (b) shared memory.

region. Each node monitors the temperature of a specific point in the region. Propose
Models for Communication ◾ 65
an algorithm for computing the maximum temperature and broadcasting the maximum
value to every sensor node. Assume that communication is by broadcasting
only, and the broadcasts are interleaved (i.e., they do not overlap), so two sensor nodes
never send or receive data at the same time.
3.6 Consider an anonymous distributed system consisting of n processes. The topology
is a completely connected network, and the links are bidirectional. Propose an algorithm
using processes that can acquire unique identifiers.
(Hint: Use coin flipping, and organize the computation in rounds.) Justify why your
algorithm will work.
3.7 In a network of mobile nodes, each node supports wireless broadcast only. These
broadcasts have a limited range, so every node may not receive all the messages, and
thus the network may not be connected. How will any given node P find out if it can
directly or indirectly communicate with another node Q? What kind of computation
models are you using for your solution?
3.8 Alice and Bob enter into an agreement: whenever one falls sick, she or he will call the
other person. Since making the agreement, no one called the other person, so both
concluded that they are in good health. Assume that the clocks are synchronized,
communication links are perfect, and a telephone call requires zero time to reach.
What kind of interprocess communication model is this?
3.9 Alice decides to communicate her secret to Bob as follows: the secret is an integer or can
be reduced to an integer. The clocks are synchronized, and the message propagation is
negligibly small. Alice first sends a 0 at time t, and then sends a 1 at time t + K, K being the
secret. Bob deciphers the secret by recording the time interval between the two signals.
What kind of interprocess communication model is this? Will this communication
be possible on a partially synchronous model where the clocks are approximately
synchronized and the upper bound of the difference between the two clocks
is known? Explain your answer.
3.10 Using the mobile agent model, design an algorithm to detect biconnectivity between
a pair of processes i and j in a network of processes. Assume that both i and j can send
out mobile agents.
3.11 A combinational digital circuit is to be simulated using an acyclic network of processes.
Each process in the simulated model will represent a gate. Model the hardware
communication using (1) CSP (explained in Exercise 3.3) and (2) link register.
Provide an example in each case.
3.12 Figure 3.6 illustrates a pipeline with n processes 1 through n. Streams of tasks are sent to
the pipeline through the entry point. Each process completes 1/n fraction of a total task
and passes it on to the next process. The finished task exits the pipeline at the exit point.
Process i accepts an item for processing, when (1) it has completed its own part, (2) it
sends an ack to its predecessor (i − 1), and (3) the predecessor (i − 1) delivers the item to
it. Initially, processes 2 through n have sent acks to their predecessors. Write a program
for process i (1 < i < n) using the state-reading model of interprocess communication.
66 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
3.13 Assuming that message propagation delays have known upper bounds, show an
implementation of the state-reading model using a message-passing model.
3.14 Consider the problem of phase synchronization, where a set of processes executes
their actions in phases and no process executes phase (k + 1) until every process
has completed its phase k(k ≥ 0). This is useful in parallelizing loop computations.
Implement phase synchronization using the shared-memory model.
3.15 In synchronous communication (also known as synchronous message passing), a
message m is sent by a process P only when the receiving process Q is ready to receive
it and vice versa. Assuming that P and Q are connected with each other by a pair of
unidirectional unit capacity links, outline the implementation of synchronous message
passing using asynchronous message passing.
3.16 A process P sends messages to another process Q infinitely often via a unidirectional
channel. The communication channel c is not FIFO. Assume now that there exists a
known upper bound of T seconds on the message propagation delay along channel c,
messages are sent out at a uniform rate of r messages per second by process P, and process
Q is faster than process P. What is the smallest size buffer that process Q is required
to maintain, if it wants to accept the messages in the same order in which P sent them?
3.17 Processes in a named system rely on process identifiers for taking certain actions.
Can you design a distributed algorithm (of your choice) that has a space complexity
O(1) on a named system? Explain your answer.
3.18 Consider a population of size n in a town and the task of multicasting a message m to
every resident of that town. Residents communicate using Twitter, and communication
is round based: in each round, a person can tweet a message to exactly one other
person. The goal is to complete the multicast as quickly as possible.
Part 1. Assume that each sender has full knowledge of who has not currently received
the message. Propose an algorithm using the multicast that is completed in the
fewest number of rounds (only the main idea using pseudocodes is needed here).
Calculate the time complexity in rounds.
*Part 2. Now assume that senders have no knowledge of who has already received the
message (senders are lazy and no one maintains the list of the residents to whom
she or he has already tweeted the message in the previous rounds). So each sender
randomly picks a resident and tweets him or her. Calculate the expected number
of rounds needed for the message to reach every resident.

Syntax and Semantics
4.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter introduces a minimal set of notations to represent distributed algorithms.
These notations do not always conform to the syntax of popular programming languages
like C or Java. They are only useful to appropriately specify certain key issues of atomicity,
nondeterminism, and scheduling in a succinct way. The notations have enough flexibility
to accommodate occasional use of even word specifications for representing actions. These
specifications are only meant for a human user who is trying to implement the system or
reason about its correctness. In [D76], Dijkstra argued about the importance of such a
language to influence our thinking habits. This is the motivation behind introducing these
simple notations for representing distributed algorithms.
4.2 GUARDED ACTIONS
A sequential process consists of a sequence of actions. Here, each action or statement corresponds
to either an internal action or a communication action. The following notation
represents a sequential process consisting of (n + 1) actions S0 through Sn:
S0 ;S1;S2 ;…;Sn ;
We structure programs as follows. To name a particular program, we will use program
<name> in the opening line. The variables and constants of a program will be introduced in
the define section, and any initial values will be separately declared in the initially section.
This will be followed by the program statements. We will designate a message as a variable
68 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
of type message. If the structure of the message is important, then we will optionally define
it as a record. Thus, a message m with three components a, b, c will be denoted as follows:
type message = record
a: integer
b: integer
c: boolean
end
define m: message
The individual components of m will be designated by m.a, m.b, and m.c. For representing
other forms of structured data, we will freely use Pascal-like notations.
A simple assignment is of the form x := E, where x is a local variable and E is an expression.
A compound assignment assigns values to more than one variable in one indivisible action.
Thus, x, y := m.a, 2 is a single action that assigns the value of m.a to the variable x and the value 2
to the variable y. The compound assignment x, y := y, x swaps the values of the variables x and y.
On many occasions, an action S takes place only when some condition G holds. Such
a condition is often called a guard. We will represent a guarded action by G → S. Thus,
x = y → x := y + 1 is a guarded action. A guarded action will also be called a statement.
A trivial extension is the alternative construct that contains more than one guarded
action. Consider the following construct:
If G0 → S0
[] G1 → S1
[] G2 → S2
.
.
[] Gn → Sn
fi
It will mean that the action Si takes place only when guard Gi is true. When no guard is
true, this reduces to the statement skip (do nothing). In case more than one guard is true,
the choice of the action that will be executed is completely arbitrary, unless specified otherwise
by the scheduler. The previous notations are adequate to represent possible nondeterministic
behaviors of programs.
Since we will deal only with abstract algorithms and not executable codes, program
declarations or statements may occasionally be relaxed, particularly when their meanings
are either obvious or self-explanatory. As an illustration, let process i send a message to
process j—process j, upon receiving a message from process i, will initiate some action. The
complete syntax for the action by process j will be
if ¬empty(i,j) → receive message m;
if m = hello → …
[] m = hi → …
fi
… … …
fi
Representing Distributed Algorithms ◾ 69
However, if (i, j) is the only channel incident on process j, or the identification of the
channel through which the message is received is not relevant to our discussion, then with
little loss of clarity, we can represent the same program as
if message = hello → …
[] message = hi →
… … …
fi
It is assumed that the message is consumed from the message buffer when it is received and
examined. Finally, we describe the repetitive construct. The notation
do G0 → S0
[] G1 → S1
[] G2 → S2
.
.
[] Gn → Sn
od
will represent a loop that is executed as long as at least one of the guards G0…Gn is true.
When two or more guards are true, any one of the corresponding actions can be chosen
for execution, and the choice is arbitrary. The execution of the loop terminates when all the
guards are false. As an example, consider the following program:
program uncertain;
define x : integer;
initially x = 0
do x < 4 → x := x + 1
[] x = 3 → x := 0
od
For the first three steps in the execution of this program, only the first guard is true, so
the action x := x + 1 is executed, and the value of x becomes 3. But what happens after
the third step? Note that both the guards are true now, so we will allow only one of the
corresponding actions to take place, the choice being completely arbitrary. If the second
action is chosen, then the value of x again becomes 0 and the first statement has to be
executed during the next three steps. If however the first action is chosen, then the value
of x becomes 4, and the loop terminates since all the guards are false. The corresponding
state diagram is shown in Figure 4.1.
Can we predict if the second action will at all be chosen when x = 3? No. This is because the
choice of an action is completely determined by the fairness of the scheduler. A fair scheduler
will eventually select the first action when x = 3, and so the program will terminate. However,
an unfair scheduler may not do so, and, therefore, termination is not guaranteed. We will
address fairness issues in Section 4.5. Readers are encouraged to explore how these execution
semantics can be specified using a well-known programming language of their choice.
70 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
A major issue in a distributed computation is global termination, which corresponds to
reaching a state in which (1) the execution of the program for each process has terminated,
that is, all guards are false, and (2) there is no message in transit along any of the channels.
This is useful when a computation is structured into a sequence of phases, each process
needs to detect whether the computation of the current phase has terminated before beginning
the next phase. We will address termination detection in Chapter 9.
4.3 NONDETERMINISM
Guarded actions representing alternative and repetitive constructs involve nondeterminism:
whenever two or more guards are simultaneously enabled, the choice of which action
will be scheduled is at the discretion of the scheduler. Define the global state A of a distributed
system as the set of all local states and channel states, and define the behavior of
a computation as a sequence of global states A0 → A1 → A2 → … → Ak → Ak+1 →…, where
A0 is the initial state. Each state transition is due to an action by some process in the system.
In a deterministic computation, the behavior remains the same during every run of
the program. However, in a nondeterministic computation, starting from the same initial
state, the behavior of a program may be different during different runs, since the scheduler
has discretionary choice about alternative actions.
This apparently complicates matters, and nondeterminism may appear to be an unnecessary
digression. However, in distributed systems, nondeterminism is quite natural.
Operating system needs to guarantee that even if device interrupts are received at unpredictable
moments, every execution of a well-behaved program consistently produces the same
output. Similarly, network delays are arbitrary, so in different runs of a distributed algorithm,
a process may receive the same set of messages in different order. This makes the case of nondeterministic
behavior a rule in distributed systems and determinism a special case.
Deterministic scheduling of actions is sometimes inadequate to generate all the possible
outcomes of a nondeterministic distributed computation. Consider a server process with
k input channels c0, c1, c2, c3, …, ck−1: when a client sends a message through one of these
channels, the server sends an acknowledgement to the sender:
define x : array [0..k − 1]of boolean
initially for all channels are empty
do ¬empty(c0) → send acknowledgement along c0
[] ¬empty(c1) → send acknowledgement along c1
… … …
[] ¬empty(ck−1) → send acknowledgement along ck−1
od
x = 0 x = 1 x = 2 x = 3 x = 4
FIGURE 4.1 The state transitions in program uncertain.
Representing Distributed Algorithms ◾ 71
A deterministic scheduler will poll the channels in a fixed order. Thus, if three messages
arrive via c0, c1, and c2 at the same time, then the server will only send acknowledgments in
the order c0c1c2 and never acknowledge these in the order c0c2c1, although this is feasible if
the channels are polled in a nondeterministic order. The semantics of deterministic choices
using if… then… else… produce a subset of the set of behaviors that are possible using
nondeterministic choice. A system that is proven correct with nondeterministic choice is
guaranteed to behave correctly under a deterministic scheduler.
4.4 ATOMIC OPERATIONS
Consider a process P with two input channels: red and blue. Suppose that two infinite
streams of messages arrive through these two channels. Also, let x be a local variable of
process P. What happens to x when the following program is executed?
do ¬empty(red) → x := 0 {red action}
[] ¬empty(blue) → x := 15 {blue action}
od
Regardless of how nondeterminism is handled, we would expect the value of x to be an
arbitrary sequence of 0’s and 15’s. However, there are some subtle issues that require closer
examination.
If each assignment is an indivisible action, then the previous conclusion is definitely true.
However, this has not been specified in the program! To realize how such a specification can
make a difference, assume that x is a four-bit integer x3x2x1x0 and assume that each assignment
is executed in four steps—each step updating only one bit of x. Thus, x := 0 is translated
to x3 := 0; x2 := 0; x1 := 0; x0 = 0 and x := 15 is translated to x3 := 1; x2 := 1; x1 := 1; x0 = 1.
With both guards constantly enabled, the scheduler may choose to interleave the actions in
the following sequence:
x3 := 0; {red action}
x3 :=1; {blue action}
x2 :=1; {blue action}
x2 := 0; {red action}
x1 := 0; {red action}
x1 :=1; {blue action}
x0 :=1; {blue action}
x0 := 0; {red action}
With this scenario, x3 = 1, x2 = 0, x1 = 1, x0 = 0 (i.e., x = 10 in decimal) will be the value
of x. In fact, depending on the pattern of interleaving, x can assume any value between
0 and 15!
72 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The previous example shows that the result of a computation can be influenced by what
operations are considered indivisible. Such an indivisible action is called an atomic action
or atomic operation. A distributed computation is an interleaved sequence of operations,
and atomicity (also called granularity) determines the types of permissible interleaving in
a distributed computation. If the actions x := 0 and x := 15 were atomic, then at any time, x
would have assumed one of these two values only.
As another illustration of the significance of atomic operations, consider a system of
three processes P, Q, R. Let process P execute the program:
define b : boolean
initially b = true
do b → send message to process Q
[] ¬empty(R,P) → receive message from process R; b := false
od
If the send operation takes a long time, but a message from R arrives before the send operation
is complete, should the arrival of the message interrupt the send operation? No, as
long as the send operation is treated as an atomic operation. However, if P recognizes the
arrival of the message from R before the send operation is scheduled and schedules the
receive operation, then it will execute the statement b := false, and the send operation will
not be scheduled at all.
The grain of an atomic operation is determined by what is considered indivisible. An
example of fine-grain atomicity is read–write atomicity, where only read and write operations
on single variable are considered indivisible. Consider a completely connected network of
n (n > 2) processes 0..n − 1, and each process i executes a program do Gi → Si od. Assume
that to evaluate the guard Gi, process i needs to read the states of all the remaining n − 1
processes in the system. With coarse-grained atomicity, the evaluation of each Gi is atomic
action. In the read–write atomicity model, however, between two consecutive read operations
by one process, another process can change its state by executing an action. Consequently,
program behaviors and outcome can change if read–write atomicity model is assumed.
Atomic actions have the all-or-nothing property. If a process performs an atomic multicast,
then either every receiver receives the message, or none of them receives it. The duration
of an atomic action is no more relevant—and for the purpose of reasoning, we can
reduce the duration to a point on the time axis.
How does a system implement the granularity or the atomicity of an action? Some levels
of atomicity are guaranteed by the processor hardware—whereas others have to be implemented
by software. In a single processor that does not use instruction pipelining, the
execution of every instruction is atomic—external interrupts are not recognized until the
execution of the current instruction is complete. In a shared-memory bus-based multiprocessor,
the bus controller implements atomic memory read and memory write operations
by serializing concurrent accesses to the shared memory. It thus provides natural
support to read–write atomicity. In many shared-memory multiprocessors, special atomic
instruction like test-and-set (TS) or compare-and-swap locks the memory bus (or switch)
Representing Distributed Algorithms ◾ 73
for two consecutive memory cycles, enabling the program to perform an indivisible
read–modify–write (RMW) operation. Such operations are effective tools for implementing
various types of locks and can be used to efficiently implement critical sections (CSs),
which are atomic units of arbitrarily large size.
In our computation model, unless otherwise stated, we will assume that every guarded
action is an atomic operation. Thus, once a guard Gi in the guarded action Gi → Si is true
and the scheduler initiates the execution of the action Si, its execution must be allowed
to complete (regardless of how much time it takes) before the guards are reevaluated and
another action is scheduled. Consider the following program:
program switch
define a, flag: boolean
initially a = true, flag = false
do a → flag := true;
flag := false
[] flag ∧ a → a := false
od
Since the first action is atomic, every time the guards are evaluated, flag is found to be false
and the second statement is never executed! So the program does not terminate. For a more
complete understanding of such issues, we introduce the notion of fairness.
4.5 FAIRNESS
In a nondeterministic program, whenever multiple guards are true, there is more than
one action to choose from. The choice of these alternatives is determined by the notion of
fairness. Fairness is a property of the scheduler, and it can affect the behavior of a program.
To understand what fairness is, consider the set of all possible schedules (i.e., sequences of
actions) in a given program. Any criterion that discards some of these schedules is a fairness
criterion. With such a general definition of fairness, it is possible to define numerous types of
fairness criteria. Of these, the following three types of fairness have received wide attention:
1. Unconditional fairness
2. Weak fairness
3. Strong fairness
A scheduler that allows all possible schedules characterizes an unfair scheduler. Consider
the following program:
program test
define x: integer {initial value undefined}
do true → x := 0
[] x = 0 → x := 1
[] x = 1 → x := 2
od
74 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
If the scheduler is unfair, then it is not impossible for it to always schedule the first action even
if the guard of the second action remains true. As a result, the value of x may never be 1 or 2.
Unconditionally fair scheduler. A scheduler is unconditionally fair when each statement is
eventually* scheduled, regardless of the value of its guard.
This version of fairness deals with scheduling at the statement level. All unconditional
statements will eventually be scheduled for execution. However, an action that is scheduled
is executed only if its guard is true at that time; otherwise, it is ignored. An unconditionally
fair scheduler is a primitive version of a fair scheduler that intends to give every action a fair
chance to execute. Thus, in the program test, an unconditionally fair scheduler may schedule
the guarded action x = 1 → x := 2 at a time when x = 0, but clearly, the action will not be
executed. However, the action x = 0 → x := 1 will definitely be executed when it is scheduled.
As an example, consider the scheduling of n processes in a multiprogrammed uniprocessor.
Traditional scheduling policies reflect unconditional fairness, which guarantees
that processor time is allocated to each of the n processes infinitely often. More refined
version of schedulers pay attention to the guards while scheduling an action. This leads to
the concepts of weakly fair and strongly fair schedulers.
Weakly fair scheduler. A scheduler is weakly fair when it eventually schedules every guarded
action whose guard becomes true and remains true thereafter.
Consider the program test again. Initially, only the first action is guaranteed to execute.
After this, the condition x = 0 holds, so the guards of the first two actions remain enabled.
The weakly fair scheduler will eventually schedule each of these two actions. Once the
second action is executed, the condition x = 1 holds, which asserts the guard of the third
action while the first guard remains enabled. So the scheduler has to choose between the
first and the third actions. If the scheduler chooses the first action, then the guard of the
third action again becomes disabled. In a valid execution, the weakly fair scheduler may
schedule the first two actions infinitely often, but may never schedule the third action,
since its guard does not remain enabled.
Finally, consider the following program fair and examine if the program will terminate
under a weakly fair scheduler:
program fair
define x,b : boolean
initially b = true
do b → x := true
[] b → x := false
[] x → b := false
[] x → x := ¬x
od
Termination of the program fair is assured only if the scheduler chooses the third and
fourth actions. But will these actions be chosen at all? With a weakly fair scheduler, there is
* Note that the term eventually corresponds to the inevitability of an action. It does not specify when or after how many
steps the action will take place, but it guarantees that the delay is finite.
Representing Distributed Algorithms ◾ 75
no guarantee that this will happen, since the guard x never stabilizes to the value true from
the first two actions. However, program fair will terminate if the scheduler is strongly fair.
Strongly fair scheduler. A scheduler is strongly fair if it eventually schedules every guarded
action whose guard is true infinitely often.
Note the difference between the two types of schedulers. The guard x in program fair does
not remain enabled, but is enabled infinitely often—so a strongly fair scheduler must eventually
execute the third action b := false, which negates the first two guards. On the same
ground, it also eventually executes the fourth action, after which the program terminates.
In all these examples, all guarded actions belong to the same process—however, this is
not necessary. The same definitions of fairness will apply when the guarded actions belong
to distinct processes in a network or the guards include variables from a pair of neighboring
processes.
Note that for a given program with a predefined initial state, the set of possible schedule
of actions (also called executions or behaviors) under a weakly fair scheduler is a subset
of the set of possible schedule of actions under a strongly fair scheduler. On one side, this
implies that from a given initial configuration A0, any state Ak that is reachable under a
weakly fair scheduler is also reachable under a strongly fair scheduler. However, on the
other side, the additional feasible executions under a strongly fair scheduler may sometimes
affect program termination, when these executions have the potential to lead the
system through a cycle of nonterminal configurations.
It is possible to come across many other types of schedulers in common applications. An
example is a FIFO scheduler. A FIFO scheduler guarantees that between two consecutive executions
of one action, every other action with an enabled guard gets the opportunity to execute
once. If there is a mechanism to order the instants at which the guards were enabled, then FIFO
scheduling guarantees that the corresponding actions are executed in that order. In real-time
systems, fairness can be specified using physical clocks—for example, “engine number 2 must
start 12 seconds after the blast-off of the spacecraft” specifies a stringent fairness property.
4.6 CENTRAL VERSUS DISTRIBUTED SCHEDULERS
The examples illustrated in the previous section dealt with a single process, whose program
consists of one or more guarded actions. We will now examine the various possibilities of
scheduling actions in a network of processes.
Since each individual process has a local scheduler, one possibility is to leave the scheduling
decisions to these individual schedulers, without attempting any kind of global coordination.
This is most natural and characterizes distributed schedulers.
Consider the system of two processes in Figure 4.2. This system uses the state-reading
model. Each process i has a Boolean variable x[i] and their initial values are arbitrary. The
goal is to lead the system to a configuration in which the condition x[0] = x[1] holds. To
meet this goal, assume that process i executes the following program:
do
x[i + 1 mod 2] ≠ x[i] → x[i] := ¬x[i]
od
76 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
With the initial values of x as shown in Figure 4.2, both processes have enabled guards.
Using the distributed scheduler model, each process can take independent scheduling
decisions as shown in Figure 4.3. Here, it is not impossible for each process i to concurrently
read the state of the other process, detect that the guard is true, and eventually
complement x[i]. As a result, the computation may potentially run forever and the goal
is never reached.
The other scheduling model is based on the interleaving of actions. It assumes the
presence of an invisible demon* that coordinates actions on a global basis. In particular,
this demon finds out all the guards that are enabled, arbitrarily picks any one of these
guards, schedules the corresponding action, and waits for the completion of this action
before reevaluating the guards. This is the model of a central scheduler or a serial scheduler.
With reference to Figure 4.2 again, if the central scheduler chooses process 0, then
until x[0] has changed from true to false, process 1 cannot evaluate the guard or execute
an action. So the computation terminates and the goal is reached in one step. This illustrates
that the choice of the type of scheduler can make a difference in the behavior of a
distributed system.
To simulate the distributed scheduling model under fine-grained atomicity, each process
must maintain a private copy of the state of each of its neighbors. Let k ∈ N(i). Let s[i, k]
designate the local copy of the state x[k] of process k as maintained by process i. The evaluation
of the guard by process i is a two-phase operation: in the first phase, process i copies
the state of each neighbor k, that is, ∀k ∈ N(i), s[i, k] := x[k]. In the second phase, each
process evaluates its guard(s) using the local copies of its neighbors’ states and decides if an
action will be scheduled. The number of steps required to copy the neighbors’ states will
depend on the grain of atomicity and the size of the state space. For example, when read–
write atomicity is assumed, only one variable of a neighbor is copied at a time, and all read

and write operations on x[k] are interleaved. However, the coarse-grained atomicity model
allows processes to read the states of all the neighbors in a single step.
The central or serial scheduler is a convenient abstraction that simplifies the reasoning
about program correctness, but its implementation requires additional effort. Based on
whatever hardware support is available, a central scheduler can be implemented by creating
a single token in the entire system and circulating that token infinitely often among the
processes in the system, as in a token ring network. Any process that receives the token is
entitled to execute a guarded action before relinquishing the token to another process. The
implementation of a single token requires an appropriate mutual exclusion protocol.
Central scheduling exhibits poor parallelism and poor scalability. Also its implementation
in a distributed setting is nontrivial. This leads to the obvious question: Why should we care
about central schedulers, when a strictly serial schedule often appears contrived? The primary
reason is the relative ease of correctness proofs, as we will observe in Chapter 5. No system will
correctly work under a distributed scheduler if it does not correctly work with a central scheduler.
In restricted cases, correct behavior with a central scheduler guarantees correct behavior
with a distributed scheduler. The following theorem represents one such case.
Theorem 4.1
If a distributed system works correctly with a central scheduler, and no enabled guard of a
process is disabled by the actions of their neighbors, then the system is also correct with a
distributed scheduler.
Proof: Assume that i and j are neighboring processes executing the guarded actions
Gi → Si and Gj → Sj, respectively. Consider the following four events: (1) the evaluation of Gi
as true, (2) the execution of Si, (3) the evaluation of Gj as true, and (4) the execution of Sj. With
a distributed scheduler, these can be scheduled in any order subject to the constraint that (1)
happens before (2) and (3) happens before (4). Without loss of generality, assume that the
scheduler evaluates Gi first. Then, distributed schedulers allow the following three schedules:
(1) (2) (3) (4)
(1) (3) (4) (2)
(1) (3) (2) (4)
However, by assumption, (4) does not affect (1), and (2) does not affect (3)—so these are
causally independent events. Also, (2) and (4) are causally independent for obvious reasons.
Since the scheduling of causally independent events has no impact on the final outcome,
they can be swapped at will, which means
(1) (3) (4) (2) ≡ (1) (3) (2) (4) ≡ (1) (2) (3) (4)
that is, the second and the third schedules can be reduced to the first one by the appropriate
swapping of events. But the first schedule corresponds to that of a central scheduler. ◾

4.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The semantics of a distributed computation depend on specific assumptions about atomicity
and scheduling policies. In the absence of a complete specification, the weakest possible
assumptions hold.
To illustrate the importance of atomicity and scheduling policies, let us take a second
look at program switch in Section 4.3. Will this program terminate with a strongly fair
scheduler, since the variable flag becomes true infinitely often? With the assumption about
the atomicity of each guarded action, the answer is no. In fact, a weakly fair scheduler also
does not guarantee termination. This is because an atomic statement is indivisible by definition,
so each time the value of flag is monitored, it is found to be false.
Termination of program switch (Section 4.3) is possible with a strongly fair scheduler,
when we split the first guarded statement as follows:
do a → flag := true;
[] a → flag := false
… … …
od
Such a split reduces the grain of atomicity. However, even with this modification, a
weakly fair scheduler cannot guarantee termination.
Finally, a note for programmers is that the language presented in this section is a specification
language only. The goal is to correctly represent the permissible overlapping or
interleaving of various types of actions as well as various possible scheduling policies that
might influence the behavior of a distributed system. For the sake of simplicity, the use of
additional notations have been reduced to a minimum and often substituted by unambiguous
sentences in English. Elsewhere, readers may find the use 〈S〉 to represent the atomic
execution of S or different variations of [] to distinguish between strong and weak fairness
in scheduling policies—but we decided to get rid of such additional symbols, since
the language is for human interpretation and not for machine interpretation. For an exact
implementation of any of these programs in an existing programming language like Java
or C++, one should not only translate the guards and the actions but also implement the
intended grain of atomicity, nondeterminism, and the appropriate fairness of the scheduler.
This may not always be a trivial task.
4.8 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Dijkstra introduced guarded actions (commands) in [D75]. The same article showed
the importance of nondeterminism and techniques for handling it. No one should miss
Dijkstra’s landmark book A Discipline of Programming [D76] for an in-depth look at program
derivation and reasoning about its correctness. In [D68], Dijkstra illustrated the
importance of atomic actions when he introduced the P and V operators for solving the
CS problem. The database community is well versed with the concept of atomic actions
in the specification of the ACID* properties of transactions. Lamport extensively stud-

ied the role of atomicity in the correctness proof of concurrent programs (see [L77] and
[L79]). In [L74], Lamport presented his bakery algorithm that showed how to implement
a coarse-grained atomic action (like a CS) without the support of read–write atomicity
at the hardware level. Francez presented a comprehensive study of fairness in his book
[F86]—we have chosen only three important types of fairness here. Central and distributed
schedulers are two prominent scheduling models in a distributed computation. It
is unclear who introduced these first and seems to be folklore—but widely used in correctness
proofs.
EXERCISES
4.1 Consider a completely connected network of n processes. Each process has an integer
variable called phase that is initialized to 0. The processes operate in rounds—at the
end of each round, every process sends the value of its phase to every other process
and then waits until it receives the value of phase from every other process, after
which the value of phase is incremented by 1, and the next round begins.
Specify the program of each process using guarded actions in the state-reading model.
4.2 Consider a strongly connected network of n processes 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1. Any process i
(called the source) can send a message to any other process j (called the destination)
in the network. Each process i has a local variable vi. A message sent out by a source
process i consists of (1) the sequence number of the message, (2) the source id, (3) the
destination id, and (4) the value of vi. We focus on the routing of the messages.
Any message has to be routed through zero or more processes. A process j receiving
a message accepts it only if it is the destination and executes the assignment vj: =
vi—otherwise, it forwards the message along its outgoing edges. The communication
is considered to be complete, when at least one copy of the message reaches the destination,
the value of the local variable is appropriately updated, and there are no other
circulating messages or pending actions.
Specify the communication from i to j using guarded actions in the message-passing
model.
4.3 A soda machine accepts only quarters and dimes. A customer has to pay 50 cents
to buy a can of soda from the machine. Specify the behavior of the machine using
guarded actions. Assume that the machine rejects any coin other than quarters and
dimes, since it cannot recognize those coins. Also, assume that the machine will not
issue a refund if a customer deposits excess money.
4.4 In a graph G = (V, E), each node i ∈ V represents a process whose state is denoted by a
nonnegative integer c(i). The program for each process i is described in the following:
do ∃j ∈ N(i):c(i) = c(j) → c(i) := c(i)+ 1 od
Transform the program from the state-reading model to the message-passing model
using a round-based computation.

4.5 Consider the following program:
program luck
define x,z : boolean
initially x = true
do x → z := ¬z
[] z → (x,z) := (false,false)
od
Will the previous program terminate if the scheduler is (1) weakly fair or (2) strongly
fair?
4.6 There are n distinct points 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1 on a 2D plane. Each point i represents a
mobile robot that is controlled by a process Pi. Pi can read the position of the points
(i − 1) and (i + 1) in addition to its own and execute an action to relocate itself to a new
position.
The goal of the following algorithm is to make the n points collinear (i.e., they fall on
the same straight line) from arbitrary initial positions. Process P0 and Pn−1 do not do
anything—every other process Pi(0 < i < n − 1) executes the following program:
program align {for i}
do (i − 1,i,i + 1) are not collinear → move i so that (i − 1,i,i + 1)
are aligned od
To make the three points collinear, assume that node i first modifies its y-value, and
then modifies its x-value only if it becomes necessary.
Will the points be aligned if there is a central scheduler that allows only one process
to move at a time? What happens with distributed schedulers and fine-grained
atomicity? Justify your answer.
4.7 A round-robin scheduler guarantees that between two consecutive actions by the same
process, every other process with an enabled guard executes its action exactly once.
Consider a completely connected network of n processes. Assuming that a central
scheduler is available, implement a round-robin scheduler using the locally sharedmemory
model. Provide brief arguments in support of your implementation.
4.8 Alice, Bob, and Carol are the members of a library that contains, among many other
books, single copies of the books A, B. Each member can check out at most two books,
and the members promise to return the books within a bounded period. Alice periodically
checks out the book A, and Bob periodically checks out the book B. Carol wants to
use both books at the same time. How will the librarian ensure that Carol receives her
books? Write the program for Alice, Bob, Carol, and the librarian. What kind of fairness
is needed in your solution? Can you solve the problem using a weakly fair scheduler?
4.9 Consider the problem in Exercise 4.8, and now assume that there are four members
Alice, Bob, Carol, and David, who are trying to share single copies of four books A, B,
C, D from the library. Periodically, Alice wants both A and B, Bob wants both B and C,
Carol wants both C and D, and David wants both D and A, and each member promises

librarian so that every member eventually receives their preferred books.
4.10 A distributed system consists of a completely connected network of three processes.
Each process wants to pick a unique identifier from the domain Z = {0, 1, 2}. Let
name[i] represent the identifier chosen by process i. The initial values of identifiers
are arbitrary. A suggested solution with coarse-grained atomicity is as follows:
program pick-a-name {for process i}
define name: integer ∈ {0, 1, 2}
do ∃j ≠ i:name[j] = name[i] ∧ x ∈ Z\{name[k]:k ≠ i} → name[i] := x

a. Verify if the solution is correct, and if not, then fix it.
b. Suggest a solution using read–write atomicity. Briefly justify why your solution
will work.
4.11 Consider a ring of n(n > 2) identical processes. The processes are sympathetic to one
another, so that when any process i executes an action, every process j ≠ i executes the
same action. Represent the operation of the processes using guarded actions using
the message-passing model.
(Hint: This is a consensus problem, where the processes have to agree about the next
action to be executed.)
4.12 (Studious philosophers) Three philosophers 0, 1, and 2 are sitting around a table. Each
philosopher’s life alternates between reading and writing. There are three books on the

left. Then he or she reads them, takes notes, and puts the books back on the table.

Program Correctness
5.1 INTRODUCTION
The designer of a distributed system has the responsibility of certifying the correctness of
the system before the users start using it. This guarantee must hold as long as every hardware
and software component works according to its specification. A system may function
incorrectly when its components fail, or the process states are corrupted by external
perturbations, and there is no provision for fault tolerance. This chapter explains what
correctness criteria are considered important for distributed systems and how to prove the
correctness properties.
Consider a distributed system consisting of n processes 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1. Let si denote the
local state of process i. The global state (also called the configuration) S of the distributed system
consists of the local states of all the processes and is defined as S = s0 × s1 × s2 × ⋯ × sn−1.
While this is adequate for systems that use shared memory for interprocess communication,
for message-passing models, the global state also includes the states of the channels.
The global state of a distributed system is also called its configuration.
From any global state si, the execution of an eligible action takes the system to the next
state Si+1. The central concept is that of a transition system. A computation is a sequence of
atomic actions S0 → S1 → S2 → ⋯ → Sf that transforms a given initial state S0 to a final state Sf.
A sequence of states and state transitions is also called a behavior of the system. With partial
ordering of events and nondeterministic scheduling of actions, such sequences are not
always unique—depending on the system characteristics and implementation policies, the
sequence of actions from any given configuration can vary from one run to another. Yet,
from the perspective of a system designer, it is important to certify that the system operates
correctly for every possible run.
Figure 5.1 represents the history of a computation that begins from the initial global
state A and ends in the final global state L. Each arc corresponds to an atomic action that
causes a state transition. Note that in each of the states B and G, there are two possible
actions: this corresponds to either data-dependent actions or nondeterministic choices
made by the scheduler(s). The history can be represented as the set of the following three
84 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
state sequences: {ABCDEFL, ABGHIFL, ABGJKIFL}. If a computation does not terminate,
then some of the behaviors can be infinite.
Regardless of what properties are considered to judge correctness, a handful of test runs
of the system can never guarantee that the system will behave correctly under all possible
circumstances. This is because such test runs may at best certify the correctness for some
specific behaviors but can rarely capture all possible behaviors. To paraphrase Dijkstra,
“test runs can at best reveal the presence of bugs, but not their absence.”
It is tempting to prove correctness by enumerating all possible interleavings of atomic
actions and reasoning about each of these behaviors. However, there is a scalability cliff—
due to the explosive growth in the number of such behaviors, this approach soon turns out
to be impractical, at least for nontrivial distributed systems. For example, with n processes
each executing a sequence of m atomic actions, the total number of possible interleavings is
( )!
( !)
n m
m n

Even for modest values of m and n, this is a very large number.* Therefore, to exhaustively
test even a small system within a reasonable time, the computing capacity available with
today’s largest and fastest computers becomes inadequate.
5.2 CORRECTNESS CRITERIA
Most of the useful properties of a system can be classified as either liveness or safety
properties.
5.2.1 Safety Properties
A safety property intuitively implies that “bad things never happen.” Different systems have different
notions of what can be termed as a bad thing. Consider the history shown in Figure 5.1
and let a safety property be specified by the following statement: “the value of a certain integer
* For n = 10, m = 4, this number >1034.

C D E

G H I
J K
L
FIGURE 5.1 The history of a distributed system: the circles represent states and the arcs represent
actions causing state transitions.
Program Correctness ◾ 85
variable temperature should never exceed 100.” If this safety property has to hold for a system,
then it must hold for every state of the system. Thus, if we find that in state G temperature = 107,
then we immediately conclude that the safety property is violated—we need not wait for what
will happen to temperature after state G. To demonstrate that a safety property is violated, it is
sufficient to demonstrate that it does not hold during an initial prefix of a behavior. Many safety
properties can be specified as an invariant over the global state of the system. What follows are
some examples of safety properties in well-known synchronization problems.
Mutual exclusion: Consider a number of processes trying to periodically enter a critical
section. Once a process successfully enters the critical section, it is expected to do some
work, exit the critical section, and then try for a reentry later. The program for a typical
process has the following structure:
do true →
entry protocol;
critical section;
exit protocol
od
Here, a safety property is that at most one process can be inside its critical section.
Accordingly, the safety invariant can be written as Ncs ≤ 1 where Ncs is the number of processes
in the critical section at any time. A bad thing corresponds to a situation in which
two or more processes are in the critical section at the same time.
Bounded capacity channel: A transmitter process P and a receiver process Q are communicating
through a channel of bounded capacity B. The usual conditions of this communication
are as follows: (1) The transmitter should not send messages when the channel is full,
and (2) the receiver should not receive messages when the channel is empty. The following
invariant represents a safety property that must be satisfied in every state of the system:
nC  nP  nC +B
where
nP is the number of items produced by the transmitter process
nC is the number of items consumed by the receiver process
B is the channel capacity
Let B = 20. A bad thing happens when nP = 45, nC = 25, and the producer produces one
more item and puts it into B.
Readers and writers’ problem: Assume that nR reader processes simultaneously read a
shared file that is updated by nW writer processes. To prevent the content of the file from
being garbled and to help the readers read out meaningful copies, (1) the writers must get
exclusive access to the file, and (2) the readers must access the file only when no writer is
writing. This safety property can be expressed by the invariant
(nW 1)(nR = 0)(nW = 0)(nR  0)
86 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
A bad thing will happen if a writer process is granted write access when a reader is
reading the file.
Absence of deadlock: A system is deadlocked when it has not reached the final configuration,
but no process has an eligible action, making further progress impossible. Clearly,
deadlock is a bad thing for any distributed system. Consider a computation that starts from
a configuration that satisfies the precondition P and is expected to satisfy the postcondition
Q upon termination. Let GG be the disjunction of all the guards of all the processes.
Then the desired safety property can be expressed by the invariant Q∨GG.
Partial correctness: An important type of safety property is partial correctness. Partial correctness
of a program asserts that if the program terminates, then the resulting state is
the final state satisfying the desired postcondition. The bad thing here is the possibility
of the program terminating with a wrong answer or entering into a deadlock. Using the
example from the previous paragraph, a program is partially correct when ¬GG ⇒ Q, so
the same safety invariant Q∨GG applies to partial correctness also. Partial correctness
does not, however, say anything about whether the given program will terminate—that is
a different and often a deeper issue.
The absence of safety can be established by proving the existence of a state that is reachable
from the initial state and violates the safety criterion. To prove safety, it is thus necessary
to assert that in every state that is reachable from the initial state, the safety property holds.
5.2.2 Liveness Properties
The essence of a liveness property is that “good things eventually happen.” Eventuality is a
tricky issue—it simply implies that the event happens after a finite number of actions, but
no expected upper bound for the number of actions is implied in the statement.* Consider
the statement:
Every criminal will eventually be brought to justice.
Suppose that the crime was committed on January 1, 1990, but the criminal is still at large.
Can we say that the statement is false? No—since who knows, the criminal may be captured
tomorrow! It is impossible to prove the falsehood of a liveness property by examining
a finite prefix of the behavior. Of course, if the accused person is taken to court today and
proven guilty, then the liveness property is trivially proved. But this may be a matter of luck
or may depend on many other things—the definition does not specify how long we have
to wait for a liveness property to hold, as long as the waiting period is finite. Here are some
examples of well-known liveness properties:
Progress: Let us revisit the classical mutual exclusion problem, where a number of processes
try to enter their critical sections. A desirable feature here is that once a process executes
its entry protocol to declare its intention to enter its critical section, it must make progress
* In probabilistic systems where the course of actions is decided by flipping a coin, it is sufficient to guarantee that the
events happen with probability 1.
Program Correctness ◾ 87
toward the goal and eventually enter the critical section. Thus, progress toward the critical
section is a liveness property. Even if there is no deadlock, the progress is violated if there
exists at least one infinite behavior, in which a process remains outside its critical section.
The absence of guaranteed progress is known as livelock or starvation.
Fairness: Fairness is a liveness property, since it determines whether the scheduler will
schedule an action in a finite time. Like most progress properties, fairness does not ordinarily
specify when or after how many steps the action is scheduled.
Reachability: Reachability addresses the following question: Given a distributed system
with an initial state S0, does there exist a finite behavior that changes the system state to Sk?
If so, then Sk is said to be reachable from S0. Reachability is a liveness property.
Network protocol designers sometimes run simulation programs to test protocols. They
explore the possible states that the protocol could lead the system into and check if any
of these is a bad or undesirable state. However, even for small protocols with a few lines
of code, the number of states can sometimes be so large that most simulations succeed in
reaching a fraction of the set of possible states within a reasonable time. Many protocols
are certified using this type of testing. The testing of reachability through simulation is
rarely foolproof and takes a heavy toll of system resources, often leading to the so-called
state-explosion problem. Testing a protocol is not an alternative to proving its correctness.
Termination: Program termination is a liveness property. It guarantees that starting from the
initial state, every feasible behavior leads the system to a configuration in which all the guards are
false and the terminal configuration is reached. Recall that partial correctness simply ensures
that the desired postcondition holds when all guards are false. It does not tell us anything about
whether the terminal state is reachable via all admissible behaviors. Thus, total correctness of a
program is the combination of partial correctness and termination. Here is an example:
Example 5.1
Consider a system of four processes P0 through P3 as shown in Figure 5.2. Each process
has a color c represented by an integer from the set {0,1,2,3}. Let c[i] represent the
color of process Pi. The objective is to devise an algorithm, so that regardless of the
initial colors of the different processes, the system eventually reaches a configuration
where no two adjacent processes have the same color.
P0
P1 P
P3
FIGURE 5.2 A system of four processes: each process tries to acquire a color that is different from
the colors of its neighbors.
88 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Let N(i) denote the set of neighbors of process Pi. We propose the following program
for every process Pi to get the job done:
program colorme{for process Pi}
do ∃Pj ∈ N(i):c(i) = c[j] → c[i] = c[i] + 2 mod 4 od
Is the program partially correct? By checking the guards, we conclude that if the program
terminates, that is, if all the guards are false, then the following condition holds:
Pj N(i) : c[i] c[j] (5.1)
By definition, this is the desired postcondition. So the system is partially correct.
However, it is easy to find out that the program may not terminate. Consider the
initial state A c[0] = 0, c[1] = 0, c[2] = 2, c[3] = 2. Figure 5.3 shows a possible sequence
of actions ABCDEFGHIJKLA in which the system returns to the starting state A
without ever satisfying the desired postcondition (5.1). This cyclic behavior demonstrates
that it is possible for the program to run forever. Therefore, the program is
partially correct, but not totally correct.
Note that it is possible for this program to reach one of the terminal states X or Y if the
schedulers choose an alternate sequence of actions. For example, if in state A, process P1
makes a move, then the state c[0] = 0, c[1] = 2, c[2] = 2, c[3] = 2 is reached and condition
(5.1) is satisfied! However, termination is not guaranteed as long as there exists a single
infinite behavior where the conditions of the goal state are not satisfied. This makes

the protocol incorrect. In this context, it is important to understand the role of the adversary
(or the demon or the scheduler). For every distributed algorithm, think of an invisible
adversary that is trying to challenge your design with the worst possible schedule. When
you feel assured that the terminal state is reachable, the omniscient adversary explores
if there exists a single behavior that can prevent the algorithm for reaching the terminal
state within a bounded time. If such a behavior is found, then the adversary wins, and you
lose. The adversary here represents the real world. To win against the adversary and guarantee
termination, one must ascertain that there is no behavior that prevents the system
from reaching the terminal configuration in a bounded number of steps.
Although most useful properties of a distributed system can be classified either
as liveness or a safety property, there are properties that belong to neither of these
two classes. Consider the statement, “there is a 90% probability that an earthquake
of magnitude greater than 9.5 on the Richter scale will hit California before the year
2025.” This is neither a liveness nor a safety property.
An implicit assumption made in this chapter is that all well-behaved programs
eventually terminate. This may not always be the case—particularly for open or
dynamic systems. An open system (also called a reactive system) responds to changes
in the environment. Many real-time systems like the telephone network or the airtraffic
control network are open systems. A system that assumes the environment to
be fixed is a closed system.
Correctness also depends on assumptions made about the underlying model. Such
assumptions include program semantics, the choice of the scheduler, or the grain of
atomicity. A given property may hold if we assume strong fairness, but may not hold
if we assume weak fairness. Another property may be true only if we choose a coarsegrain
atomicity but may cease to hold with fine-grain atomicity.
5.3 CORRECTNESS PROOFS
The set of possible behaviors of a distributed system can be very large, and testing is not
a feasible way of demonstrating the correctness of nontrivial system. What is required
is some form of mathematical reasoning. Established methods like proof by induction or
proof by contradiction are widely applicable. However, mathematical tools used to prove
correctness often depend on what properties are being investigated. The techniques for
proving safety properties are thus different from the techniques for proving liveness properties.
In this chapter, we will review some of the well-known methods for proving correctness,
as well as a few formal systems and transformation techniques that lead to a better
understanding of the semantics of distributed computation. We particularly focus on the
following four topics:
1. Assertional methods of proving safety properties
2. Use of well-founded sets for proving liveness properties
3. Programming logic
4. Predicate transformers
90 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Most of these methods require a good understanding of propositional logic and predicate
logic. We therefore begin with a brief review of propositional and predicate logic.
5.3.1 Quick Review of Propositional Logic
A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. Thus, Alice earns $2000 a month is a
proposition, but x is very large is not a proposition. The axioms and expressions of propositional
logic use the following symbols:
• The propositional constants true and false represent universal truth and universal
falsehood, respectively.
• The propositional variables P, Q, R, etc., can have a value true or false.
• The propositional operators ¬∧∨= capture the notions of not, and, or, implies, and
equal to, respectively, in commonsense reasoning.
The basic axioms of propositional logic are shown in Figure 5.4. Readers are encouraged
to reason each of these axioms using commonsense. These axioms can be used to prove
every assertion in propositional logic. Consider the following example.
Example
Prove that P ⇒ P∨Q.
Proof P ⇒ P∨Q
= ¬P∨(P∨Q) {Axiom 5}
= (¬P∨P)∨Q {Axiom 8a}

FIGURE 5.4 The basic axioms of propositional logic.
Program Correctness ◾ 91
Pure propositional logic is not adequate for proving the properties of a program, since
propositions cannot be related to program variables or program states. This is, however,
possible using predicate logic, which is an extension of propositional logic.
5.3.2 Brief Overview of Predicate Logic
Propositional variables, which are either true or false, are too restrictive for real applications.
In predicate logic, predicates are used in place of propositional variables. A predicate
specifies the property of an object or a relationship among objects. Consider a program
variable x. Then the relation x < 1000 is a predicate. A predicate is associated with a set,
whose properties are often represented using the universal quantifier ∀ (for all) and the
existential quantifier ∃ (there exists). A predicate using quantifiers takes the following form:
<Quantifier> <bound variable(s)> : <range> :: <property>
Examples of predicates using quantifiers are as follows:
• (∀x, y : x, y are positive integers :: x ⋅ y = 63) designates the set of values {(1, 63), (3, 21),
(7, 9), (9, 7), (21, 3), (63, 1)} for the pair of bound variables (x, y).
• A system contains n(n > 2) processes 0, 1, 2,…n − 1. The state of each process
is either 0 or 1. Then the predicate (∀i, j : 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1:: state of process i = state of
process j) characterizes a property that holds for the set of processes {0, 1, 2, … n − 1}.
Some widely used axioms with quantified expressions are shown in Figure 5.5.
The axioms of predicate logic are meant for formal use. However, for the sake of developing
familiarity with these axioms, we encourage the reader to develop an intuitive understanding
of these axioms. As an example, consider the infinite set S = {2, 4, 6, 8, …}. Here, “for
all x in the set S, x is positive and even” is true. Application of Axiom 5 in Figure 5.5 and
Axiom 10a in Figure 5.4 leads to the equivalent statement: “there does not exist an element
x in the set S, such that x is not even or not positive”—a fact that can be understood without
any difficulty.

5.4 ASSERTIONAL REASONING: PROVING SAFETY PROPERTIES
Assertional methods have been extensively used to prove the correctness of sequential
programs. In distributed systems, assertional reasoning is an important tool for proving
safety properties. Let P be an invariant representing a safety property. To demonstrate that
P holds for every state of the system, we will use the method of induction. We will show
that (1) P holds in the initial state, and (2) if P holds at a certain state, then the execution
of every action enabled at that state preserves the truth of P. A simple example is given in
the following:
Example 5.2
Consider the system of Figure 5.6 where a pair of processes T and R communicates
with each other by sending messages along the channels c1 and c2. Process T has
a local variable t, and process R has a local variable r. The program for T and R are
described in the following paragraph. We will demonstrate that the safety property
P, “The total number of messages in both channels is ≤10,” is an invariant for
this system.
(Communication between two processes T and R)
define c1,c2: channel;
initially c1 = Ø, c2 = Ø;
{program for T}
define t: integer {initially t = 5}
1 do t > 0 → send a message along c1; t := t − 1
2 [] ¬empty(c2) → receive a message from c2; t := t + 1
od
{program for R}
define r: integer {initially r = 5}
3 do ¬empty(c1) → receive a message from c1; r := r + 1
4 [] r > 0 → send a message along c2; r := t − 1
od
Let n1 and n2 denote the number of messages in the channels c1 and c2, respectively.
To prove the safety property P, we will establish the following invariant:
I  (t  0)(r  0)(n1+t +n2 +r =10)
T R
c1
c2
FIGURE 5.6 A two-process system.
Program Correctness ◾ 93
It trivially follows that I ⇒ P. We now prove by induction that I holds at every state
of the system.
Basis: Initially, n1 = 0, n2 = 0, t = 5, r = 5 so I holds.
Inductive step: Assume that I holds in the current state. We need to show that I will
hold after the execution of every eligible guarded action in the program.
{After action 1} The values of (t + n1), n2, and r remain unchanged. Also, since the
guard is true when t > 0, and the action decrements t by 1, the condition t ≥ 0
continues to hold. Therefore, I holds.
{After action 2} The values of (t + n2), n1, and r remain unchanged. Also, the value
of t can only be incremented, so t ≥ 0 holds. Therefore, I continues to hold.
{After action 3} The values of (r + n1), n2, and t remain unchanged. Also, the value
of r can only be incremented, so r ≥ 0 holds. Therefore, I continues to hold.
{After action 4} The values of (r + n2), n1, and t remain unchanged. Also, since the
guard is true when r > 0 and the action decrements r by 1, the condition r ≥ 0
continues to hold. Therefore, I holds.
To summarize, I is true in the initial state. Also, if I holds at a certain state, then I holds
at the following state. Therefore, I holds in every state of the system. Since I ⇒ P, P holds.
5.5 PROVING LIVENESS PROPERTIES USING WELL-FOUNDED SETS
A classical method of proving a liveness property is to discover a mapping function f :
S → WF, where S is the set of global states of the system and WF = {w1, w2, w3, …} is a wellfounded
set. Among the elements of the well-founded set, there should be a total order ≫,
such that the following two properties hold:
• There does not exist any infinite chain w1 ≫ w2 ≫ w3… in WF.
• If an action changes the system state from s1 to s2, and w1 = f(s1), w2 = f(s2), then
w1 ≫ w2.
Eventual convergence to a goal state is guaranteed by the fact that if there exists an infinite
behavior of the system, then it must violate the first property. The function f is called a
measure function (also called a variant function), since its value is a measure of the progress
of computation toward its goal.
The important issue in this type of proof is to discover the right WF and f for a given
computation. A convenient (but not the only possible) choice of WF is the set of nonnegative
integers, with ≫ representing the > (greater than) relationship. In this framework, the initial
state maps some positive integer in WF and the goal state often corresponds to the integer 0.
The proof obligation reduces to finding an appropriate measure function f, so that every eligible
action from a state S reduces the value of f(s). Another example of WF is a set of tuples
with ≫ denoting the lexicographic order. The next example illustrates this proof technique.
94 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Example 5.3: Phase Synchronization Problem
Consider an array of clocks 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1 as shown in Figure 5.7. Each clock has
three values 0, 1, 2 called its phase. These clocks tick at the same rate in lock-step synchrony.
Under normal conditions, every clock displays the same phase. This means
that if every clock displays x at the current moment, then after the next step (i.e., clock
tick), all clocks will display (x + 1)mod 3. When the clocks exhibit this behavior, we
say that their phases are synchronized.
Now assume that due to unknown reasons, the clocks are out of phase. What program
should the clocks follow so that eventually their phases are synchronized and
remain synchronized thereafter?
Let c[i] represent the phase of clock i and N(i) denote the set of neighbors of
clock i. We choose the model of locally shared variables, where each clock reads the
phases of all of its neighbors in one atomic step but updates only its own phase. We
propose the following program for every clock i:
{program synch: program for clock i)
do ∃j ∈ N(i):c[j] = c[i] + 1 mod 3 → c[i] := c[i] + 2 mod 3
[] ∀j ∈ N(i):c[j] ≠ c[j] + 1 mod 3 → c[i] := c[i] + 1 mod 3
od
Before demonstrating the proof of convergence (which is a liveness property),
we encourage the readers to try out a few cases and watch how the phases are
synchronized after a finite number of clock ticks. Observe that once the clock
phases are synchronized, they remain so forever, since only the second action is
chosen.
To prove convergence to a good state using a well-founded set, first consider a pair
of neighboring clocks i and (i + 1). If c[i + 1] = c[i] + 1mod 3, then draw an arrow (←)
from clock (i + 1) to i; else if c[i] = c[i + 1] + 1mod 3, then draw an arrow (→) from
clock i to (i + 1). There is no arrow between i and (i + 1) when c[i] = c[i + 1]. From an
arbitrary initial state (which may be reached via a failure or a perturbation), observe
the following facts about the proposed protocol:
Observation 1: If a clock i(0 < i < n − 1) has only a → but no ← pointing toward
it, then after one step, the → will shift to clock (i + 1). In the case of i = n − 1,
the → will disappear after one step. There can be no arrow pointing toward
clock 0.

c[0] c[1] c[2] c[3] c[n–1]
FIGURE 5.7 An array of three-phase clocks: every clock ticks as 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, … .
Program Correctness ◾ 95
Observation 2: If a clock i (0 < i < n − 1) has only a ← but no → pointing toward it,
then after one step, the ← will shift to clock i − 1. In the case of i = 0, this arrow
will disappear after one step. There can be no arrow pointing towards clock n − 1.
Observation 3: If a clock i (0 < i < n − 1) has both a ← and a → pointing toward it,
then after one step, both arrows will disappear. This possibility is ruled out for
both clock 0 and clock n − 1.
To prove that the clocks will eventually synchronize, define a function D that maps
the set of global states of the system to a set of nonnegative integers:
D = d[0]+d[1]+d[2]++d[n −1]
where
d[i] = 0 if there is no arrow pointing toward clock i
= i + 1 if there is a ← pointing toward clock i
= n − 1 if there is a → pointing toward clock i
= 1 if there are both a ← and a → pointing toward clock i
By definition, ∀i: d(i) ≥ 0, so D ≥ 0. Based on observations 1–3, if D > 0, then D will
decrease after each step of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, regardless of the size of
the system, in a bounded number of moves, the value of D will be reduced to 0, after
which the first guard of the proposed program will no longer be enabled, and the
phases of all the clocks will be synchronized. Once synchronized, they will remain
so thereafter (action 2).
Such counting arguments help compute the upper bound on the number of steps
required for convergence to the target configuration. Each arrow can take at most n − 1
steps to disappear, and the arrows move synchronously. Therefore, it requires at most
n − 1 clock ticks for the phases to be synchronized.
Nondeterminism and fairness models sometimes make it difficult to compute an upper
bound for time complexity. Consider the following example:
program step
define m,n: integer
initially m = 1, n = 0
do m ≠ 0 → m:= 0
[] m ≠ 0 → n:= n + 1
od
If the scheduler is unfair, then termination of the aforementioned program is not guaranteed.
With a weakly fair scheduler, termination is guaranteed, but it is impossible to
determine as such after how many steps this program will terminate, since there is no clue
about when the first action will be scheduled. Much will depend on how the nondeterminism
and fairness models are implemented.

5.6 PROGRAMMING LOGIC
Programming logic, first introduced by Hoare [H69, H72], is a formal system that manipulates
predicates consisting of program states and relations characterizing the effects of
program execution. One can reason about many aspects of program correctness using the
rules of programming logic.
A program S transforms a precondition P that holds before the execution of the program
into a postcondition Q that holds after the execution of the program. In programming
logic, this is represented using the triple:
{P} S {Q}
Here, P and Q are predicates or assertions. An example of a triple is
{x = 5} x := x +1{x = 6}
Every valid triple is called a theorem of programming logic. A theorem can be derived from
more basic theorems (called axioms) using the transformation rules of programming logic.
Some important axioms of programming logic are presented in the following:
Axiom 5.1
{P} skip {P} (skip means do nothing)
Axiom 5.2
{Q[x ← E]} x: = E{Q}
Here, E denotes an expression or a value, x ← E is an assignment, and Q[x ← E] denotes
the condition derived from Q by substituting every occurrence of the variable x by the corresponding
expression E. Consider the following examples, where ? denotes the unknown
precondition of the triple {?} S {Q}:
Example 5.4
{?} x: = 1 {x = 1}
? = (1 =1) = true
Thus, {true}x:= 1{x = 1} is a theorem.
Example 5.5
{?} x: = 2x + 1 {x > 99}
? = (2x +1 > 99) = (2x > 99) = (x > 49)
Thus, {x > 49}x: = 2x + 1{x > 99} is a theorem.
Program Correctness ◾ 97
Example 5.6
{?} x: = 100 {x = 0}
? = (100 = 0) = false
Thus, {false} x: = 100 {x = 0} is a theorem.
Axiom 5.3
{Q[x ← y, y ← x]} (x, y): = (y, x) {Q}
Axiom 5.3 tells us how to compute the precondition in case of a swap. Here, Q[x ← y,
y ← x] implies simultaneous substitution of x by y and y by x in Q.
Appropriate inference rules extend the applicability of the axioms of programming logic.
Let the notation H/C designate the fact that the hypothesis H leads to the conclusion C. To
illustrate the use of these inference rules, consider the triple:
{x =100} x : = 2x +1{x > 99}
Intuitively, this is a correct triple. But how do we show that it is a theorem in programming
logic? Example 5.5 computes the corresponding precondition as (x > 49), which is
different from (x > 100)! However, it follows from simple predicate logic that (x = 100) ⇒
(x > 49), so the triple {x = 100}x: = 2x + 1{x > 99} should be a theorem. Similarly, {x = 100}
x: = 2x + 1{x > 75} should also be a theorem, since(x = 99) ⇒ (x > 75). The inference rule
can now be represented by Axiom 5.4:
Axiom 5.4
( ,{ } { }, )
{ } { }
 
 
P P P S Q Q Q
P S Q
The essence of the aforementioned axiom is that the strengthening of the precondition
and the weakening of the postcondition have no impact on the validity of a triple.
Axiom 5.5 illustrates how inference rules can help specify the semantics of the sequential
composition operator “;.”

98 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Example 5.7
Prove that {y > 48} x: = y + 1; x: = 2x + 1 {x > 99} is a theorem.
{x > 49}x := 2x +1{x > 99} (Example 5.5) (5.2)
Also, {y + 1 > 49} x: = y + 1 {x > 49} (Axiom 5.2).
This implies
{y > 48} x: = y + 1{x > 49} (5.3)
Therefore, {y + 1 > 49} x: = y + 1{x > 99} {using (5.2), (5.3), and Axiom 5.5}.

if G1 → S1

Assume that the guards are disjoint and let GG = G1∨G2∨⋯∨Gn. When ¬GG holds
(which means all guards are false), IF reduces to a skip statement. From Axiom 5.1, it follows
that (¬GG∧P) ⇒ Q. However, if some guard Gi is true, then the execution of Si leads
to the postcondition Q, so {P∧Gi}Si{Q} is a theorem. These interpretations lead to the following
semantics of the alternative construct:
Axiom 5.6

Finally, consider the iterative construct DO in the triple {P}DO{Q}:

The semantics of this iterative construct can be represented in terms of a loop invariant.
A loop invariant I is a predicate that is true at every stage from the beginning to the end
Program Correctness ◾ 99
of a loop. Initially, P ≡ I. Also, in order that the postcondition Q holds, the loop must terminate—
so ¬GG must eventually hold. Therefore, Q = ¬GG ∧ I. Furthermore, since the
execution of each Si preserves the invariance of I, {I ∧ Gi} Si {I} holds. Combining these
facts, we obtain the following axiom:
Axiom 5.7
({ } { } : )
{ } { }
I G S I i n
I DO GG I
i i  
¬

Note that in DO loops, programming logic cannot determine if the loop will terminate—it
can only decide that if the program terminates, then the postcondition holds.
The axioms of predicate logic and programming logic have useful applications in correctness
proofs. An example of application is the assertional proof of sequential programs.
Starting from the given precondition P for a program S = S1; S2; S3; …; Sn, the assertion Qi
is computed after the execution of each statement Si. The program is proven to be correct
when Qn ⇒ Q, the desired postcondition. An annotated program showing the intermediate
assertions is called a proof outline.
5.7 PREDICATE TRANSFORMERS
Consider the question: “What is the largest set of initial states, such that the execution of
a program S starting from any of these states (1) is guaranteed to terminate and (2) results
in a postcondition Q?” This question is of fundamental importance in the field of program
derivation, and we will briefly address it here. The set of all initial states satisfying the
aforementioned two conditions is known as the weakest precondition wp(S, Q). Since wp
maps the predicate Q into the predicate wp(S, Q), it is also called a predicate transformer.
If P ⇒ wp(S, Q), then {P} S {Q} is a theorem in programming logic. Note that a theorem in
programming logic does not require termination, whereas predicate transformers imply
properly terminating behavior. Some useful axioms with predicate transformers [D76] are
given in the following:
Axiom 5.8
wp(S, false) = false (law of excluded miracle)
Proof Assume that for some program S, wp(S, false) ≠ false. Then there exists an initial
state from which the execution of S terminates and results in a final state that satisfies false.
But no state satisfies the predicate false. ◾
100 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Axiom 5.9
If Q ⇒ R, then wp(S, Q) ⇒ wp(S, R) (property of monotonicity).
Axiom 5.10
wp(S, Q) ∧ wp(S, R) ⇒ wp(S, Q∧R)
Axiom 5.11
wp(S, Q) ∨ wp(S, R) ⇒ wp(S, Q∨R)
Proof
wp(S, Q) ⇒ wp(S, Q∨R) (Axiom 5.9)
Similarly, wp(S, R) ⇒ wp(S, Q∨R) (Axiom 5.9).
Therefore, wp(S, Q)∨wp(S, R) ⇒ wp(S, Q∨R) (propositional logic). ◾
Note: For a deterministic computation, the ⇒ in Axiom 5.11 can be replaced by =. As an
illustration, consider the following program, where nondeterminism plays a crucial role in
deciding the value of x after every step:
Program toss;
define x : integer;
if true → x := 0
[] true → x := 1
fi
Here, wp(toss, x = 0) = false, and wp(toss, x = 1) = false
(since no initial state can guarantee that the final value of x will be 0 or 1).
However, wp(toss, x = 0 ∨ x = 1) = true
(since from every initial state, the final value of x must be either 0 or 1).
This is in agreement with the statement of Axiom 5.11, but it falls apart when the implication
⇒ is replaced by the stronger relation =. Now consider the next program mod, which
is different from toss.
Program mod
define x: integer
if x = even → x := 0
[] x = odd → x := 1
fi
Program Correctness ◾ 101
Here, unlike program toss, regardless of the initial value of x, if wp(mod, x = 1) = false,
then wp(mod, x = 1) = true and vice versa. Since wp(mod, x = 0 ∨ x = 1) = true, it is in agreement
with the note following Axiom 5.11. Of course, it is only an example and not a proof.
Axiom 5.12
wp ((S1;S2 ),Q) = wp (S1,wp (S2 ,Q))
Axiom 5.13
wp(IF, Q) = (¬GG ⇒ Q) ∧ (∀i: 1 ≤ i ≤ n:: Gi ⇒ wp(S1, Q))
The most significant difference from programming logic is in the semantics of the DO
loop, since termination is a major issue. The predicate transformer of a DO statement
requires the loop to terminate in k or fewer iterations (i.e., k being an upper bound). Let
Hk(Q) represent the largest set of states starting from which the execution of the DO loop
terminates in k or fewer iterations. The following two conclusions immediately follow:
• H0(Q) = ¬GG ⇒ Q
• Hk(Q) = H0(Q)∨wp(IF, Hk−1(Q))
Using these, the semantics of the DO loop can be specified as follows:
Axiom 5.14
wp(DO, Q) = ∃k ≥ 0: Hk(Q)
An extensive discussion of program derivation using predicate transformers can be found
in [D76] and [G81].
5.8 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Formal treatments sharpen our reasoning skills about why a program should work or fail.
While such treatments can be convincingly demonstrated for toy examples, formal reasoning
of nontrivial examples is often unmanageably complex. This obviously encourages the
study of automated reasoning methods. An alternative is program synthesis. A program S
composed of a set of subprograms using a set of composition rules is guaranteed to work
correctly, if each subprogram works correctly, and the composition rules are certified by
the axioms of a formal program derivation system.
A powerful tool for reasoning about the dynamic behavior of programs and their
properties is temporal logic. It provides a succinct expression for many useful program
102 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
properties using a set of temporal operators. Note that predicate logic and propositional
logic cater to timeless properties. To take a peek at temporal logic, let us consider the two
important operators ♢ and ◽. If P is a property, then consider the following:
• ◽ P implies that P is always true. This is useful for expressing invariants in safety
properties.
• ♢ P implies that P will eventually become true. This is useful for expressing liveness
properties.
The two operators are related as P = ¬ (¬P) . This can be intuitively reasoned as follows:
if P represents the property of termination of a program S, then the statement “the program
S will eventually terminate” can also be stated as “it is not always true that program
S will not terminate.”
A formula is an assertion about a behavior. Every property can be expressed by a formula,
which is built from elementary formulas using the operators of propositional logic
and the operators ♢ and ◽. The following are useful in dealing with temporal properties
and can be reasoned with intuition:
P  Q = (P Q)
P  Q  (P Q)
(Note that P  Q  (P Q), since if P and Q change with time, and Q = ¬P, then the left
side may be false, but the right side is true.)
P  Q = (P Q)
(F G) = ( F)( G)
(Note that ◽♢P (always eventually true) is true for a behavior if and only if ♢P is true
at all times during that behavior. This is synonymous with “P is true infinitely often.”).
Finally,
 P  P
Temporal logic formulas can be used to specify various fairness models introduced in
Chapter 4. For example, consider the construct do Gi → Si []Gj → Sj od. Under a weakly
fair scheduler, action Sj will be scheduled for execution if ♢◽Gj holds, which means there is
a time t after which Gj will be always true. Under a strongly fair scheduler, action Sj will be
scheduled for execution if ◽♢Gj holds, that is, Gj is true infinitely often.
To learn more about temporal logic, read Manna and Pnueli’s book [MP92].

5.9 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
The original work on proving the correctness of sequential programs was done by Floyd
[F67]. In [H69], Hoare developed the framework of programming logic. Ashcroft and
Manna [AM71] were the first to prove properties of about concurrent programs. In [H72],
Hoare extended his partial correctness proof of sequential programs to include concurrency.
A more complete treatment of the subject is available in Susan Owicki’s dissertation,
a summary of which can be found in [OG76]. Here, Owicki and Gries proposed how
to prove the partial correctness of concurrent programs where processes communicate
through a shared memory.
Lamport [L77] introduced the terms safety and liveness. These were originally taken
from the Petri net community who used the term safety to designate the condition that no
place contains more than one token and the term liveness to designate the absence of deadlock.
The book by David Gries [G81] is a comprehensive text on correctness proofs that no
beginner should miss. Dijkstra [D76] introduced predicate transformers and demonstrated
how they can be used to derive programs from scratch. Amir Pnueli introduced temporal
logic [P77]. Manna and Pnueli’s book [MP92] contains a complete treatment of the specification
and verification of concurrent systems using temporal logic. Owicki and Lamport
[OL82] demonstrated the use of temporal logic to prove liveness properties of concurrent
programs. In [L94], Lamport developed a complete proof system called TLA based on temporal
logic. Chandy and Misra developed an alternative proof system called UNITY—a
comprehensive treatment of their work can be found in their book [CM88].

Prove that the program does not terminate.
5.5 Consider a connected network (V, E), where each vertex v ∈ V is an unbounded clock.
All clocks are ticking at the same rate and displaying the same value. Due to electrical
disturbances, one or more of these clock values might occasionally be perturbed.

action with each clock tick and the action takes zero time to complete. Prove
using a well-founded set and an appropriate variant function that the clocks will start
displaying the same value in a bounded number of steps. Also, what is the round
complexity of the algorithm?
5.6 If a distributed computation does not terminate with a strongly fair scheduler, then

back into the jar (assume that by the side of the jar, there is an adequate supply of
black beans).
b. If the two beans have different colors, then throw the black bean and return the
white bean into the jar.
What is the color of the last bean, and how is it related to the initial content in the
coffee jar? Furnish a proof in support of your answer.

5.10 Consider a tree (V, E), where each node i ∈ V represents a process. Each node i has a
color c[i] ∈ {0,1}. Starting from an arbitrary initial configuration, the nodes have to
acquire a color such that no two neighboring nodes have the same color. We propose
the following algorithm for each process i:
program twocolor
define c[i]: color of process i {c = 0 or 1}
do j ∈ N(i):c[i] = c[j] → c[i] := 1 − c[i] od

explain why. Otherwise, give a proof of termination.
5.11 This is a logical continuation of the previous question. Consider that you have a
rooted tree with a designated root. Each node (except the root) has a neighbor that is
designated as its parent node. If j is the parent of i, then i cannot be the parent of j.
Now try the same problem (of coloring) as in Question 10, but this time, use a different
algorithm:
program treecolor (for process i}
define c[i]: color of process i
p[i]: parent of process i
do c[i] = c[p[i]] → c[i] := 1 − c[i] od

explain why. Otherwise, give a proof of termination.
5.12 Consider an array of n(n > 3) processes. Starting from a terminal process, mark the
processes alternately as even and odd. Assume that the even processes have states ∈{0, 2},
and the odd processes have states ∈{1, 3}. The system uses the state-reading model
and distributed scheduling of actions. From an unknown starting state, each process
executes the following program:
program alternator {for process i}
define s ε{0,1,2,3}{state of a process}
do ∀j ∈ N(i):s[j] = s[i] + 1 mod 4 → s[i] := s[i] + 2 mod 4

Time in a Distributed System
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Time is an important parameter in a distributed system. Consistency maintenance among
replicated data relies on which update is the most recent one. Real-time systems like airtraffic
control must have accurate knowledge of time to provide useful service and avoid
catastrophe. Important authentication services (like Kerberos) rely on synchronized
clocks. Wireless sensor networks rely on accurately synchronized clocks to compute the
trajectory of fast-moving objects. High-frequency trading [D09], where fast computers scan
millions of accounts in a second and run complex algorithms for implementing various
trading strategies in a matter of milliseconds, relies heavily on the accuracy of time synchronization.
Before addressing the issues related to time in distributed systems, let us
briefly review the prevalent standards of physical time.
6.1.1 Physical Time
The notion of time and its relation to space have intrigued scientists and philosophers since
the ancient days. According to the laws of physics and astronomy, real time is defined in
terms of the rotation of Earth in the solar system. A solar second equals 1/86,400th part
of a solar day, which is the amount of time that the Earth takes to complete one revolution
around its own axis. This measure of time is called the real time (also known as
Newtonian time) and is the primary standard of time. Our watches or other timekeeping
devices are secondary standards that have to be calibrated with respect to the primary
standard.
Modern timekeepers use atomic clocks as a de facto primary standard of time. Per this
standard, a second is precisely the time for 9,192,631,770 orbital transitions of the cesium
133 atom. In actual practice, there is a slight discrepancy—86,400 atomic seconds is close
to 3 ms less than a solar day, so when the discrepancy grows to about 1 s, a leap second is
added to the atomic clock.
International Atomic Time (TAI) is an accurate time scale that reflects the weighted
average of the readings of nearly 300 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.
It has been available since 1955 and became the international standard on which
108 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
UTC is based. UTC was introduced on January 1, 1972, following a decision taken by the
14th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). The International Bureau of
Weights and Measures is in charge of the realization of TAI.
UTC, popularly known as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) or Zulu time, differs from the
local time by the number of hours of your time zone. The use of a central server receiving
the WWV shortwave signals from Fort Collins, Colorado, and periodically broadcasting
the UTC-based local time to other timekeepers is quite common. In fact, inexpensive
clocks driven by these signals are now commercially available.
Another source of precise time is GPS. A system of 32 satellites deployed in the Earth’s
orbit maintains accurate spatial coordinates and provides precise time reference almost
everywhere on Earth where GPS signals can be received. Each satellite broadcasts the
value of an onboard atomic clock. To use the GPS, a receiver must be able to receive
signals from at least four different satellites. While the clock values from the different
satellites help obtain the precise time, the spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude, and
the elevation of the receiver) are computed from the distances of the satellites estimated
by the propagation delay of the signals. The clocks on the satellites are physically moving
at a fast pace, and per the theory of relativity, this causes the onboard clocks to run at a
slightly slower rate than the corresponding clocks on the Earth. The cumulative delay per
day is approximately 38 ms, which is compensated using additional circuits. The atomic
clocks that define GPS time record the number of seconds elapsed since January 6, 1980.
At present (i.e., in 2013), the GPS time is nearly 16 s ahead of UTC, because it does not
use the leap second correction. Receivers thus apply a clock-correction offset (which is
periodically transmitted along with the other data) in order to display UTC correctly and
optionally adjust for a local time zone.
6.1.2 Sequential and Concurrent Events
Despite technological advances, the clocks commonly available at the processors distributed
across a system do not exactly show the same time. Built-in atomic clocks are not yet
cost-effective—for example, wireless sensor networks cannot (yet) afford an atomic clock at
each sensor node, although accurate timekeeping is crucial to detecting and tracking fastmoving
objects. Certain regions in the world cannot receive such time broadcasts from reliable
timekeeping sources. GPS signals are difficult to receive inside a building. The lack of
a consistent notion of system-wide global time leads to several difficulties. One difficulty is
the computation of the global state of a distributed system (defined as the set of local states
of all processes at a given time). The special theory of relativity tells us that simultaneity
has no absolute meaning—it is relative to the location of the observers. If the time stamps
of a pair of events are nanoseconds apart, then we cannot convincingly say which one happened
earlier, although this knowledge may be useful to establish a cause–effect relationship
between the events. However, causality is a basic issue in distributed computing—the
ordering of events based on causality is more fundamental than that obtained using physical
clocks. Causal order is the basis of logical clocks, introduced by Lamport [L78]. In this
chapter, we will address how distributed systems cope with uncertainties in physical time.
Time in a Distributed System ◾ 109
6.2 LOGICAL CLOCKS
An event corresponds to the occurrence of an action. A set of events (a, b, c, …) in a single
process is called sequential, and their occurrences can be totally ordered in time using the
clock at that process. For example, if Bob returns home at 5:40 p.m., answers the phone at
5:50 p.m., and eats dinner at 6:00 p.m., then the events (return home, answer phone, eat
dinner) define an ascending sequential order. This total order is based on a single and consistent
notion of time that Bob believes in accordance with his clock.
In the absence of perfectly reliable timekeepers, two different physical clocks at two
different locations will always drift. Even if they are periodically resynchronized, some
inaccuracy in the interim period is unavoidable. The accuracy of synchronization depends
on clock drift as well as on the resynchronization interval. Thus, 6:00 p.m. for Bob is not
necessarily exactly 6:00 p.m. for Alice at a different location, even if they live in the same
time zone. Events at a single point can easily be totally ordered on the basis of their times
of occurrences at that point. But how do we decide if an event with Bob happened before
another event with Alice? How do we decide if two events are concurrent?
To settle such issues, we depend on an obvious law of nature: no message can be received
before it is sent. This is an example of causality. Thus, if Bobs ends a message to Alice, then
the event of sending the message must have happened before the event of receiving that message
regardless of the clock readings. The importance of causal relationship can be traced in
many applications. For example, during a chat, let Bob send a message M to Carol and Alice
and Alice post a reply Re:M back to Bob and Carol. Clearly M happened before Re:M. To
make any sense of the chat, Carol should always receive M before Re:M. If two events are not
causally related, then we do not care about their relative orders and call them concurrent.
The aforementioned observations lead to three basic rules about the causal ordering
of events, and they collectively define the happened before (or the causally ordered before)
relationship ≺ in a distributed system:
Rule 1: Let each process have a physical clock whose value is monotonically increasing. If
a, b are two events within a single process P, and the time of occurrence of a is earlier than
the time of occurrence of b, then a ≺ b.
Rule 2: If a is the event of sending a message by process P, and b is the event of receiving the
same message by another process Q, then a ≺ b.
Rule 3: (a ≺ b)∧(b ≺ c) ⇒ (a ≺ c).
Figure 6.1 illustrates these rules using a space–time diagram. Here, P, Q, and R are three
different sequential processes at three different sites. At each site, there is a separate physical
clock, and these clocks tick at an unknown pace. The horizontal lines at each site indicate
the passage of time. Based on the rules mentioned previously, the following results hold:
bh since (bc)(c g )(g h)
a d since (a b)(bc)(c d)
110 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
However, it is impossible to determine any causal ordering between the events (a, e)—
neither a ≺ e holds, nor e ≺ a holds. The same thing applies to (c, f) and (b, h). In such
a case, we call the two events concurrent (a ǁ b). It must be clear from this example that
the events in a distributed system cannot always be totally ordered. The happened before
relationship defines a partial order, and concurrency corresponds to the absence of causal
ordering.
A logical clock is an event counter that respects causal ordering. Consider the sequence
of events in a single sequential process. Each process has a counter LC that represents its
logical clock. Initially, for every process, LC = 0. The occurrences of events correspond to
the ticks of the logical clock local to that process. Every time an event takes place, LC is
incremented. Logical clocks can be implemented using three simple rules:
LC1: Each time a local event takes place, increment LC by 1.
LC2: When sending a message, append the value of LC to the message.
LC3: When receiving a message, set the value of LC to 1+ max (local LC, message LC),
where local LC is the local value of LC and message LC is the LC value appended with the
incoming message.
The aforementioned implementation of logical clocks provides the following limited
guarantee for a pair of events a and b:
a bLC(a)<LC(b)
However, the converse is not true. In Figure 6.1, LC(f) = 2 and LC(h) = 5, but there is no
causal order between f and h. This is a limitation of logical clocks.
Although causality induces a partial order, in many applications, it is important to define
a total order among events. For example, consider the server of an airline handling requests
for reservation from geographically dispersed customers. A fair policy for the server will be
to allocate the next seat to the customer who sent the request ahead of others. If the physical
clocks are perfectly synchronized and the message propagation delay is zero, then it is
trivial to determine the order of the requests using physical clocks. However, if the physical

FIGURE 6.1 A space–time view of events in a distributed system consisting of three processes
P, Q, R: the horizontal lines indicate the timelines of the individual processes, and the diagonal lines
represent the flow of messages between processes. Each event is tagged with its logical clock value.
Time in a Distributed System ◾ 111
clocks are not synchronized and the message propagation delays are arbitrary, then determining
a total order among the incoming requests becomes a challenge.
One way to evolve a consistent notion of total ordering across an entire distributed system
is to strengthen the notion of logical clocks. If a and b are two events in processes i and j
(not necessarily distinct), respectively, then define total ordering (≪) as follows:
a b LCa LC b
LCa LC b i j
 iff either
or and
( ) ( )
( ) ( )
<
= <
where i < j is determined either by the relative values of the numeric process identifiers or
by the lexicographic order of their names. Whenever the logical clock values of two distinct
events are equal, their process numbers or names will be used to break the tie. The
(id, LC) value associated with an event is called its time stamp.
It should be obvious that a ≺ b ⇒ a = b. However, its converse is not necessarily true.
While the definition of causal order is quite intuitive, the definition of concurrency as
the absence of causal order leads to tricky situations that may appear counterintuitive. For
example, the concurrency relation is not transitive. Consider Figure 6.1 again. Here, f is
concurrent with g, and g is concurrent with d, but f is not concurrent with d.
Even after the introduction of causal and total order, some operational aspects in
message ordering remain unresolved. One such problem is the implementation of FIFO
communication across a network. Let m, n be two messages sent successively by a process
P to another process R (via arbitrary routes). Here, the FIFO property implies that
if send(m) ≺ send(n) holds, then the recipient process R must receive message m before
receiving message n.
In Figure 6.2, P first sends the first message m directly to R and then sends the next
message n to Q, who forwards it to R. Although send(m) ≺ send(n) holds, and each channel
individually exhibits FIFO behavior, there is no guarantee that m will reach R before n.
Thus, send(m) ≺ send(n) does not necessarily imply receive(m) ≺ receive(n).
This anomalous behavior can sometimes lead to difficult situations. For example, even
if a server uses the policy of servicing requests based on time stamps, it may not always
be able to do so, because the request bearing a smaller time stamp may not have reached
the server before another request with a larger time stamp. At the same time, no server
is clairvoyant—that is, it is impossible for the server R to know whether a request with
a lower time stamp will ever arrive in future. This is an important issue in distributed

simulation, which requires that the temporal order of events in the simulated environment
be a true reflection of the corresponding order in the real system. We will address
this in Chapter 18.
6.3 VECTOR CLOCKS
One major weakness of logical clocks is that the LC values of two events cannot reveal
if they are causally ordered. Vector clocks, independently discovered by Fidge [F88] and
Mattern [M88] overcome this weakness. The primary goal of vector clocks is to detect
causality. Let V denote the set of all events in a distributed system of n processes 0…n−1
and A denote the set of nonnegative integer vectors of size n. Then vector clock is a mapping
VC: V → A.
Let a, b ε V. Denote the ith element of VC(a) by VCi(a). Define a partial order < among
the vector clock values as follows: VC(a) < VC(b) if and only if the following two conditions
hold:
1. ∀i: 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1: VCi(a) ≤ VCi(b)
2. ∃j: 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1: VCj(a) < VCj(b)
For a pair of events a, b, if neither VC(a) < VC(b) nor VC(b) < VC(a) holds, then VC(a):
VC(b), and the events are concurrent, that is, a ǁ b.
Since causality detection is one of the primary goals of vector clocks, its implementation
is required to satisfy the following condition:
a bVC(a)<VC(b)
To implement a system of vector clocks, each process i initializes its vector clock VC[i] to
0, 0, 0, …, 0 (n components). Subsequently, each process follows the following three rules:
Rule 1: Each local event at process i increments the ith component of its latest vector clock
value by 1 (i.e., VCi[i]:=VCi[i]+1).
Rule 2: The sender of a message appends the vector clock value of the send event to every
message that it sends.
Rule 3: When process j receives a message with a vector clock value T from another process,
it first increments the jth component of its own latest vector clock by 1 (i.e., VCj[i]:=VCj[i]+1)
and then updates its vector clock as follows:
k : 0  k  n −1::VCk[j]:=max(Tk ,VCk[j])
An example is shown in Figure 6.3. The event with vector time stamp (2,1,0) is causally
ordered before the event with the vector time stamp (2,1,4) but is concurrent with the event
having time stamp (0,0,2).
Time in a Distributed System ◾ 113
Although vector clocks detect causal ordering or the lack of it, a problem is their poor
scalability. As the size of the system increases, so does the size of the clock. Consequently,
in dynamic systems, the addition of a process requires a reorganization of the state space
across the entire system. Even if the topology is static, for large-scale systems, the communication
bandwidth suffers when messages are stamped with the value of the vector
clock. In Chapter 15, we will discuss the use of vector time stamps in solving the problem
of causally ordered group communication.
6.4 PHYSICAL CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION
6.4.1 Preliminary Definitions
Consider a system of n physical clocks (0, 1, 2, …, n − 1) ticking approximately at the same
rate. Such clocks may not accurately reflect real time, and despite great care taken in building
these clocks, their readings slowly drift apart over time. Therefore, these clocks need
to be periodically resynchronized to bring the discrepancies within acceptable bounds.
The availability of synchronized clocks simplifies many problems in distributed systems.
Air-traffic control systems rely on accurate timekeeping to monitor flight paths and avoid
collisions. Some security mechanisms depend on the physical times of events, so a loss of
synchronization may be a potential security lapse. Multiversion objects need accurate time
stamps to recognize the most recent version.
Ordinary quartz-oscillator-based clocks maintain time with an accuracy of 0.2 s/day, but
the accuracy is affected by temperature and aging. GPS receivers can provide time with an
accuracy of 1 ms, but they work mostly outdoors for a clear sky view. The National Institute of
Science and Technology (NIST) radio station WWV that broadcasts from Boulder, Colorado,
or Washington, DC, provides time information with an accuracy of 4–10 ms depending in
the distance of the receiver. The overhead of processing these signals by a computer adds
some more slack to the accuracy of timekeeping. This is sometimes compounded by failures
and occasional unpredictability in the signal propagation delays. For reasons of convenience
and cost, many of these solutions are not ideal for every machine or every application.
Accordingly, most machines try to adjust their times by periodically asking other machines.
Three main problems have been studied in the area of physical clock synchronization:
External synchronization: The goal of external synchronization is to maintain the reading
of each clock as close to the UTC as possible. A time server is a machine that provides

114 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
accurate time information to be used as a reference by other machines. The NTP (Network
Time Protocol) is an external synchronization protocol that runs on the Internet and coordinates
a number of time servers. This enables a large number of computers connected to
the Internet to synchronize their local clocks to within a few milliseconds from the UTC.
NTP takes appropriate recovery measures against possible failures of one or more servers
as well as the failure of links connecting the servers.
Internal synchronization: The goal of internal synchronization is to keep the readings of
a system of autonomous clocks closely synchronized with one another, despite the failure
or malfunction of one or more clocks. These clock readings may not have any connection
with UTC or GPS time—mutual consistency is the primary goal. Of course external
synchronization implies internal synchronization, but many applications do not need
the extra work. For example, wireless sensor networks measure the distance between a
source and a destination node by measuring the propagation delay of a reference signal.
The internal clocks of the sensor nodes are ordinarily built from inexpensive oscillators.
Accurate internal synchronization between the source and the destination clocks allows
the application to accurately measure the propagation delay of the signal and calculate
the distance by multiplying the propagation delay by the speed of signal. Here, external
synchronization is unnecessary.
Phase synchronization: Many distributed computations run in phases: in a given phase, all
processes execute some actions, which are followed by the next phase. A phase clock is an
integer-valued variable that is incremented each time a phase completes. Each process has
its own copy of the phase clock. In the clock phase synchronization problem, we assume
a synchronous model where all phase clock variables are incremented in unison, as if all
of them are driven by the same clock. Clearly, once all the phase variables are equal, they
remain so forever, and synchronization becomes unnecessary. However, due to transient
failures, phase clocks may occasionally differ, so that while all the nonfaulty clocks tick
as 1,2,3,4,…, the faulty clock might tick as 6,7,8,9,… during the same time. A clock phase
synchronization algorithm guarantees that starting from an arbitrary configuration, eventually
the values of all the phase clocks become identical.
Bounded and unbounded clocks: A clock is bounded, when with every tick, its value c is
incremented in a mod M field, M > 1. Such a clock has only a finite set of possible values
(0, 1, 2, …, M − 1). After M − 1, the value of c rolls back to 0. The value of an unbounded
clock on the other hand increases monotonically, and thus, such a clock can have an infinite
number of possible values.
Due to the finite space available in physical systems, only bounded clock values can be
recorded. It may appear that by appending additional information like year and month, a
clock reading can look unbounded. Consider Figure 6.4 for an example of a clock reading.
Even this clock will overflow in the year 10,000. Anyone familiar with the Y2K problem
[Y2K] knows the potential danger of bounded clocks: as the clock value increases
beyond M, it changes to 0 instead of M + 1, and computer systems consider the corresponding
event as an event from the past. As a result, many anticipated events may not
be scheduled.
Time in a Distributed System ◾ 115
The solution to this problem by allocating additional space for storing the clock values is
only temporary. All that we can guarantee is that clocks will not overflow in the foreseeable
future. A 64-bit clock that is incremented every microsecond will not overflow for nearly
20 trillion years. However, when we discuss about fault tolerance, we will find out that a
faulty clock can still overflow very easily and cause the old problem to resurface.
Drift rate: The maximum rate by which the value of a clock drifts from the ideal time (or
the real time) is called the drift rate ρ. With ordinary crystal-controlled clocks, the drift
rate is around 1 in 106. For the best atomic clocks, the drift rate is much smaller (around
1 in 1013). A drift rate ρ guarantees that

Clock skew: The maximum difference δ between any two clocks that is allowed by an application
is called the clock skew (Figure 6.5).

drift with respect to one another as well as with respect to UTC. To keep the clock readings

close to one another, the clocks are periodically resynchronized. The maximum difference
R between two consecutive synchronization actions is called the resynchronization interval,
and it depends on the maximum permissible clock skew in the application.
6.4.2 Clock Reading Error
In physical clock synchronization, there are some unusual sources of error that are
specific to time-dependent variables only. Having accurate clocks is not of much value
unless those clocks can be accurately read. Some of the sources of error in reading clocks
are as follows:
Propagation delay: If clock i sends its reading to clock j, then the accuracy of the received
value must depend not only on the value that was sent but also on the message propagation
delay. Note that this is not an issue when other types of values (which are not time sensitive)
are sent across a channel. Even when the propagation delay due to the physical separation
between processes is negligible, the operating system at the receiving machine may
defer the reading of the incoming clock value and thus introduce error. Ideally, we need to
simulate a situation when a clock ticks in transit to account for these overheads. A single
parameter ε (called the reading error) accounts for the inaccuracy.
Processing overhead: Every computation related to clock synchronization itself takes a
finite amount of time that needs to be separately accounted for.
6.4.3 Algorithms for Internal Synchronization
Berkeley algorithm: A well-known algorithm for internal synchronization is the Berkeley
algorithm, first used in Berkeley UNIX 4.3 BSD. The basic idea is as follows: the participating
processes elect a leader that coordinates the clock synchronization. The leader process
periodically reads the clocks from all the participant processes, computes the average
of these values, and then reports back to the participants the adjustment that needs be
made to their local clocks, so that clock skew never exceeds the permissible limit δ. The
algorithm assumes that the condition holds in the initial state. A participant whose clock
reading lies outside the maximum permissible skew δ is disregarded when computing the
average. This prevents the overall system time from being unfavorably skewed due to one
or more erroneous clocks. Figure 6.6 shows an example. The rationale behind sending
the needed correction instead of the computed average value is that the absolute value is
influenced by the propagation delay, whereas the needed correction hardly changes during
the signal propagation time. One note of caution: the adjustments are to be applied to the
clocks in such a way that the monotonicity property of clocks is not violated. Thus, negative
corrections will be implemented via a slowdown of the clock, whereas positive corrections
will be implemented via an appropriate speedup.
The algorithm handles the case where the notion of faults may be a relative one: for
example, there may be two disjoint sets of clocks, and in each set, the clocks are synchronized
with one another, but no clock in one set is synchronized with any other clock in the
second set. Here, to every clock in one set, the clocks in the other set are faulty. The final
outcome is determined by the choice of the leader process.
Time in a Distributed System ◾ 117
Lamport and Melliar–Smith’s algorithm: This algorithm is an adaptation of the Berkeley
algorithm, with some extra features. It not only handles faulty clocks but also handles
two-faced clocks, an extreme form of faulty behavior, in which two nonfaulty clocks obtain
conflicting readings from the same faulty clock.* The algorithm assumes that the clocks
are initially synchronized and that they are resynchronized often enough so that no two
nonfaulty process clocks ever differ by more than δ. For the sake of simplicity, disregard
the overhead due to propagation delay or computation overhead and consider clock reading
to be an instantaneous action. Let ck[i] denote clock i’s reading of clock k’s value. Each
clock i repeatedly executes the following three steps:
Step 1: Reads the value of every clock in the system.
Step 2: Discards outliers and substitutes them by the value of the local clock. Thus, if
|ci[i] − cj[i]| > δ, then cj[i]: = ci[i].
Step 3: Updates the clock reading using the average of these values.
The aforementioned algorithm guarantees that in a system of n processes, the clocks
remain synchronized even if there are at most t two-faced clocks, when n > 3t. To verify
this, consider two distinct nonfaulty clocks i and j reading a third clock k. Two cases are
possible:
Case 1: If clock k is nonfaulty, then ck[i] = ck[j].
Case 2: If clock k is faulty, then they can produce any reading. However, a faulty clock can
make other clocks accept their readings as good values even if they transmit erroneous
readings that are at most 3δ apart. Figure 6.7 illustrates such a scenario.
* Such a possibility is not a fantasy—it has been observed in real situations.

chosen for this system.
118 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The following values constitute a feasible set of readings acceptable to every clock:
• ci[i] = c
• ck[i] = c + δ
• cj[j] = c − δ
• ck[j] = c − 2δ
Now assume that at most t out of the n clocks are faulty, and the remaining clocks are
nonfaulty. Then, the maximum difference between the averages computed by any two nonfaulty
processes is 3tδ/n. If n > 3t, then (3tδ/n) < δ, which means that the algorithm keeps
c[i] and c[j] within the permissible skew δ and the nonfaulty clocks remain synchronized.
How often do we need to run the aforementioned algorithm? To maintain synchrony,
the resynchronization interval R should be small enough so that the cumulative drift does
not offset the convergence achieved after each round of synchronization. A sample calculation
is shown in the following:
As a result of the synchronization, the maximum difference between two nonfaulty
clocks is reduced from δ to 3tδ/n. Let n = 3t + 1. Then the amount of correction is

If ρ is the maximum rate at which two clocks drift apart, then it will take a time
≤ δ/(ρ ⋅ (3t + 1)) before their difference grows to δ again and resynchronization becomes
necessary. By definition, this is the upper bound of the resynchronization interval R.
Therefore, R ≤ δ/(ρ ⋅ (3t + 1)). If the resynchronization interval increases, then the system
must be designed to tolerate a larger clock skew.
6.4.4 Algorithms for External Synchronization
Cristian’s method: In this method, a client obtains the data from a special host (called the
time server) that contains the reference time obtained from some precise external source.
Cristian’s algorithm compensates for the clock reading error. The client sends requests to

the time server every R units of time where R < δ/2ρ (this follows from the fact that in an
interval Δt, two perfectly synchronized clocks can be 2 · Δt · ρ apart and 2 · ρ · R ≤ δ), and the
server sends a response back to the client with the current time. For an accurate estimate
of the current time, the client needs to estimate how long it has been since the time server
replied. This is done by assuming that the client’s clock is reasonably accurate over short
intervals and that the latency of the link is approximately symmetric (the request takes as
long to get to the server as the reply takes to get back). Given these assumptions, the client
issues an RPC to measure the round-trip time (RTT = T2 − T1; see Figure 6.8) of the request
using its local clock and then divide it by half (trajectory 2 of Figure 6.8) to estimate the
propagation delay. As a result, if clock i receives the value TS from the time server, then c[i]
corrects itself to TS RTT TS T T + ( 2) = + (( 2 − 1 ) 2).
However, this assumption about symmetric delays may not be realistic, and congestion
in the network can increase these delays in one or both directions in unpredictable ways,
leaving room for uncertainty in the calibration. To estimate this, let min be the minimum
transit time in each direction. Two extreme possibilities are shown as cases 1 and 3 in
Figure 6.8—for the same values of (T1, T2), the server may report any value in the interval
[TS,TS]. The length of this interval is (T2 − T1 − 2 min). Accordingly, the accuracy of the
client clock is limited to ±(((T2 −T1 ) 2)−min). The zone of uncertainty can be further
reduced using repeated measurements of T1 and T2 and using the smallest of the measured
intervals, which leads to a tighter estimate of the true server time. Synchronizing the clock
from multiple time servers helps improve the accuracy and overcome server failures.
Network Time Protocol: NTP is an elaborate external synchronization mechanism designed
to synchronize clocks on the Internet with the UTC. It is not practical to equip every computer
with atomic clocks or GPS satellite receivers. Cost is a major factor. So, these computers
use the NTP to synchronize the clocks. The time servers are located at different sites on
the Internet. NTP architecture is a tiered structure of clocks, whose accuracy decreases as its
level (defined by a stratum number) increases. In stratum 0, there are primary time servers
that are devices of the highest precision, like cesium clocks or GPS-based clocks. The stratum
0 clocks are directly connected to the computers in the next level (i.e., stratum 1).

possibilities are shown.
120 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The stratum 1 computers act as time servers for the computers belonging to the next level
(i.e., stratum 2). In general, stratum i computers act as time servers for the stratum (i + 1)
computers. NTP synchronizes clocks on the Internet despite occasional loss of connectivity,
failure of some of the time servers, and malicious timing inputs from untrusted sources.
Figure 6.9 shows the hierarchy with three stratum 0 nodes.
A computer will try to synchronize its clock with several servers and accept the best
results to set its time. Accordingly, the synchronization subnet is dynamic. The quality
of a time service depends on several factors, like the stratum of the server, the round-trip
delay, and the consistency of the network transit times. In a sense, NTP is a refinement of
Cristian’s method. NTP provides time service using the following three mechanisms:
Multicasting: The time server periodically multicasts the current time to the client
machines. All messages are delivered via UDP. This is the simplest method and perhaps
the least accurate. The readings are not compensated for signal delays.
Procedure call: The client processes send requests to the time server, and the server responds
by providing the current time. Using Cristian’s method, each client can compensate for the
propagation delay by using an estimate of the round-trip delay. The resulting accuracy is
better than that obtained using multicasting.
P2P communication: NTP allows a time server to synchronize its clock with another time
server operating at the same stratum. The P2P mode is used by master servers at lower
strata, and it enables them to provide a more accurate time service to the client computers.
This leads to the highest accuracy compared to the previous two methods.
As an example of this mode, consider the exchange of a pair of messages between two
time servers P and Q as shown Figure 6.10. Server P sends a probe at time T1, which is
received by server Q at its local time T2. Server Q responds to this query at its local time T3,
which is received by server P at its local time T4. Define the offset between two servers P and
Q as the difference between their clock values. Let TPQ and TQP be the message propagation

delays from P to Q and Q to P, respectively. Without loss of generality, assume that server
Q’s time is ahead of server P’s time by an offset δ. Then
T2 T1 TPQ = + + (6.1)
T4 T3 TQP = + − (6.2)
Adding (6.1) and (6.2),
T2 T4 T1 T3 TPQ TQP + = + + ( + )
So, the round-trip delay
TPQ TQP T T T T + = + − − 2 4 1 3 (6.3)
Subtracting (6.2) from (6.1),
2 2 4 1 3  = (T −T −T +T )−(TPQ −TQP )
Therefore, the offset
 = T2 −T4 −T1 +T3 −TPQ −TQP
2 2
(6.4)
Assume that x = (T2−T4−T1+T3)/2 and the round-trip delay y = TPQ + TQP. Since TPQ > 0 and
TQP > 0, the value of (TPQ − TQP) must lie between +y and −y. Therefore, the actual offset δ must
lie in the range [x + (y/2), x − (y/2)]. Note that TPQ and TQP are not individually measurable, but
x and y can be calculated from the values of (T1, T2, T3, T4). Therefore, if each server bounces
messages back and forth with another server and computes several pairs of (x, y), then a good
approximation of the real offset δ can be obtained from that pair in which the round-trip delay
y is the smallest, since that will minimize the dispersion in the window [x + (y/2), x − (y/2)].
The multicast mode of communication is considered adequate for a large number
of applications. When the accuracy from the multicast mode becomes inadequate, the

procedure call mode is used. An example is a file server on a LAN that wants to keep
track of when a file was created (by communicating with a time server at a higher level,
i.e., a lower-level number). Finally, the P2P mode is used only with the higher-level time
servers (stratum 1) for achieving the best possible accuracy. The synchronization subnet
reconfigures itself when some servers fail or become unreachable. NTP can synchronize
clocks within an accuracy of 1–50 ms.
6.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In asynchronous distributed systems, absolute physical time is not important, but the
temporal order of events is significant for some applications. As an example, in replicated
servers, each server is a state machine whose state is modified by the inputs from its
clients.
In order that all replicas always remain in the same state (so that one can seamlessly
switch to a different server if one crashes), all replicas must receive the inputs from
clients in the same order.
The performance of a clock synchronization algorithm is determined by how close two
distinct clock times can be brought, the time of convergence, and the nature of failures
tolerated by such algorithms. The adjustment of clock values may have interesting side
effects. For example, if a clock is advanced from 171 to 174 during an adjustment, then the
time instants 172 and 173 are lost. This will affect potential events scheduled at these times.
On the other hand, if the clock is turned back from 171 to 169 during adjustment, then the
time instants 169 through 171 appear twice. This causes the anomaly that an event at time
170 happens before another event at time 169! A simple fix for such problems is to appropriately
speed up or slow down the clock for an appropriate number of ticks (until one catches
up with the other) without violating the clock monotonicity property, instead of abruptly
turning the clock forward or backward.
6.6 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Lamport [L78] introduced logical clocks. In the year 2000, the distributed systems community
adjudged this paper as the most influential paper in the field of distributed systems
(later renamed as Dijkstra Prize after Edsger W. Dijkstra since 2003). In [M88], Mattern
[M88] and Fidge [F88] independently proposed vector clocks. Gusella and Zatti [GZ89]
developed the Berkeley algorithm for internal synchronization in 1989. The averaging
algorithm for physical clock synchronization is the first of the three algorithms proposed
by Lamport and Melliar-Smith in [LM85]. Cristian’s algorithm is based on his work [C89].
David Mills designed the NTP, and a good introduction can be found in [M91].

6.8 A limitation of time stamps is their unbounded size, since finite resources are inadequate
to store or process them. The goal of this exercise is to explore if boundedsize
time stamps can be used in specific solutions. Explore this possibility in the
following scenario: Two processes (0, 1) compete with each other to acquire a
shared resource that can be used by one process at a time. The life of the processes
is as follows:
Program for process i ∈ {0,1}

Request for a resource;
Acquire and use the resource;
Release the resource

124 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
To request the resource, a process sends a time stamp request to the other process,
which grants the request only if (1) it is not interested in the resource at that moment
or (2) its own time stamp for resource request is larger than the time stamp of the
incoming request. In all other situations, the grant is deferred. After receiving the
grant, a process acquires the resource. Once a process acquires a resource, it guarantees
to release the resource within a finite amount of time. Thereafter, in a finite time,
the resource is released.
Can you solve the problem using time stamps of bounded size? Explain your answer.
(Hint: First find out what is the maximum difference between the time stamps of the
two processes if the time stamps are unbounded. The time stamp of bounded size
must resolve the order of requests without any ambiguity.)
6.9 (Sequential time stamp assignment) There are n processes that are initially passive.
At any time, a process may want to be active and execute an action, for which it has
to acquire a time stamp that is larger than the time stamp of the remaining n − 1
processes. An allocator process will allocate a time stamp and can service one request
for a new time stamp at any time.
The goal is to use time stamps of bounded size. The scenario can be viewed as a
game between an adversary and the allocator: the adversary will identify a process
that will request for a time stamp, and the allocator has to assign the time stamp to
that process. For example, if n = 2, then a solution exists with time stamps 0, 1, 2,
where ts(i) = ts(j) + 1 mod 3 implies that the time stamp (ts) of process i is larger than
the time stamp of process j. Verify if this is true.
Can you find an algorithm for assigning bounded time stamps for arbitrary
values of n?
6.10 An anonymous network is one in which processes do not have identifiers. Can you
define a total order among events in an anonymous network of processes?
6.11 Five processes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in a completely connected network decide to maintain a
distributed bulletin board. No central version of it physically exists, but every process
maintains an image of it. To post a new bulletin, each process multicasts every
message to the other four processes, and recipient processes willing to respond to
an incoming message multicast their responses in a similar manner. To make any
sense from a response, every process must accept every message and response in
causal order, so a process receiving a message will postpone its acceptance unless
it is confident that no other message causally ordered before this one will arrive
in future.
To detect causality, the implementation uses vector clocks. Each message or
response is tagged with an appropriate vector time stamp. Figure out (a) a rule
for assigning these vector time stamps and (b) the corresponding algorithm using
which a process will decide whether to accept a message immediately or postpone
its acceptance.

Mutual Exclusion
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Mutual exclusion is a fundamental problem in concurrent programming and has been
extensively studied under different contexts. Imagine that n users (n > 1) want to print
data on a shared printer infinitely often. Since at most one user can print at any time,
there should be a protocol for the fair sharing of that printer. As another example, consider
a network of processes, where each process has a copy of a shared file F. To be consistent,
all copies of F must be identical, regardless of how individual processes perform
their read or write operations. Simultaneous updates of the local copies will violate the
consistency of F. A simple way to achieve this is to give each process exclusive write access
to its local copy of F during write operations and propagate all updates to the various
local copies of F with the other processes, before any other process starts accessing its
local copy. This shows the importance of studying the mutual exclusion problem. The
problem can be generalized to the access of any shared resource on a network of processes.
In multiprocessor cache coherence, at most one process has the right to update
a shared variable. A well-known implementation of mutual exclusion is found in the
CSMA/CD protocol used to resolve bus contention in Ethernets.
Most of the classical solutions to the mutual exclusion problem have been studied
for shared-memory systems with read–write atomicity. In this chapter, we will examine
both shared-memory and message-passing solutions. We begin with message-passing
solutions.
7.2 SOLUTIONS ON MESSAGE-PASSING SYSTEMS
In the message-passing model of a distributed system, the mutual exclusion problem
can be formulated as follows: Consider n(n > 1) processes, numbered 0.. n − 1 forming
a distributed system. The topology is a completely connected graph, so that every
process can directly communicate with every other process in the system. Each process
periodically wants to enter a CS, executes the CS codes, and eventually exits the CS to
130 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
do the rest of its work. The problem is to devise a protocol that satisfies the following
three conditions:
ME1: [Mutual exclusion] At most, one process can remain in its CS at any time. This is
a safety property.
ME2: [Freedom from deadlock] In every configuration, at least one process must be eligible
to take an action and enter its CS. This is also a safety property.
ME3: [Progress] Every process trying to enter its CS must eventually succeed. This is a
liveness property.
The violation of ME3 is known as livelock or starvation. In such a case, one or more
processes may be prevented from entering their CSs for an indefinite period by other
processes.
A measure of fairness is the criterion of bounded waiting. Let process i try to enter its CS.
Then, the bounded waiting requirement specifies an upper bound on the number of times
other contending processes may enter their CSs between two consecutive CS entries by
process i. Most message-passing solutions implement FIFO fairness, where processes are
admitted to their CS in the ascending order of their request time stamps. It is customary to
assume that every process entering its CS eventually exits the CS—thus, process failure or
deadlock within the CS is totally ruled out.
Many practical solutions to this problem rely on the existence of a central coordinator
that acts as a manager of the CSs. This coordinator can be an extra process or one of the
n processes in the system that has been assigned additional responsibilities. Any process
trying to enter its CS sends a request to the coordinator and waits for the ack message from
the coordinator, which is an approval for entering the CS. Similarly, any process willing to
exit its CS sends out a release message. The coordinator monitors the status of the processes
and decides when to send the ack to a certain process.
While such a solution is quite intuitive and criteria ME1, ME2, and ME3 can be easily
satisfied, it is neither easy nor obvious how to implement FIFO fairness. To realize
this, consider that process i sends a request x for entry into its CS and then sends a
message m to process j. Process j, after receiving m, sends a request y for entry into its CS.
Therefore x ≺ y. However, even if the channels are FIFO, request x may not reach the
coordinator before request y. Furthermore, if y reaches the coordinator first, then there
is no way that the coordinator can anticipate the arrival of another request x with a
lower time stamp.
In this chapter, we disregard centralized solutions using coordinators and present only
decentralized algorithms, where every process has equal responsibility in the implementation
of mutual exclusion.
7.2.1 Lamport’s Solution
The first published solution to this problem is due to Lamport. It works on a completely
connected network and assumes that interprocess communication channels are FIFO.
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 131
Each process maintains its own private request-queue Q. The algorithm is described by the
following five rules:
LA1: To request entry into its CS, a process sends a time-stamped request to every other
process in the system and also enters the request in its local Q.
LA2: When a process receives a request, it places it in its Q. If the process is not in its CS,
then it sends a time-stamped ack to the sender. Otherwise, it defers the sending of the
ack until its exit from the CS.
LA3: A process enters its CS, when (1) its request is ordered ahead of all other requests
(i.e., the time stamp of its own request is less than the time stamps of all other requests)
in its local Q and (2) it has received the acks from every other process in response to
its current request.
LA4: To exit from the CS, a process (1) deletes the request from its local queue and
(2) sends a time-stamped release message to all the other processes.
LA5: When a process receives a release message, it removes the corresponding request
from its local queue.
Correctness proof: To prove correctness, we need to show that the program satisfies properties
ME1–ME3.
Proof of ME1 (by contradiction): Let two different processes i and j enter their CSs at the
same time. Since both processes received all the acks, both i and j must have received
each other’s requests and entered them in their local queues. If process i enters its CS, then
Q.i.ts < Q.j.ts, and if j enters its CS, then Q.i.ts > Q.j.ts. Both of these cannot be true at the
same time. Therefore, both i and j cannot enter their CSs at the same time. ◾
Proofs of ME2 and ME3 (by induction): Since every request sent out by a process i is
acknowledged and no message is lost, every process eventually receives (n − 1) ack signals.
Our proof is based on the number of processes that are ahead of process i in its
request queue.
Basis: When process i makes a request, there may be at most (n − 1) processes ahead of
process i in its request queue.
Inductive step: Assume that there are K (1 ≤ K ≤ n − 1) processes ahead of process i in its
request queue. In a finite time, process j with the lowest time stamp (1) enters CS, (2) exits
CS, and (3) sends out the release message to every other process including i. Process i then
deletes the entry for process j, and the number of processes ahead of process i is reduced
from K to K − 1. Subsequent requests from process j must be placed behind that of process i,
since the time stamp of such requests is greater than that of i. It thus follows that in a
bounded number of steps, the number of processes ahead of process i will be reduced to 0,
and process i will enter its CS. ◾
132 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Proof of FIFO fairness (by contradiction): Let the time stamp of the request from process i
be less than the time stamp of the request from process j. Assume that process j enters
its CS before process i does so. This implies that when process j enters its CS, it has not
received the request from process i. However, according to LA3, it must have received the
ack of its own request from process i. By assumption, the channels are FIFO—so ack
of j’s request from i must be ahead of the request from i. However, no request can be
acknowledged before it is received. So, request from j ≺ ack of j’s request from i. It thus
follows that request from j ≺ request from i, which contradicts our earlier assumption.
Therefore, process i must enter its CS before process j. ◾
Observe that when all requests are acknowledged, the request queue of every process is
identical—so the decision to enter CS is based on local information that is globally consistent.
Also, broadcasts are atomic—so all request messages bear the same time stamp and are
transmitted without interruption. It leads to unnecessary complications if this view is overlooked,
and each request message from one process to another is assumed to have different
(i.e., progressively increasing) time stamps, or the broadcast is interrupted prematurely.
The message complexity is the number of messages required to complete one round
trip (i.e., both entry and exit) to the CS. Each process sends (n − 1) request messages and
receives (n − 1) acks to enter its CS. Furthermore, (n − 1) release messages are sent as part
of the exit protocol. Thus, the total number of messages required to complete one round
trip to the CS is 3(n − 1).
7.2.2 Ricart–Agrawala’s Solution
Ricart and Agrawala proposed an improvement over Lamport’s solution to the distributed
mutual exclusion problem. Unlike Lamport’s algorithm, processes do not maintain local
queues—instead, each process counts the number of acks that it receives from other processes,
which determines whether it will enter its CS. Four rules form the basis of this algorithm:
RA1: Each process seeking entry into its CS sends a time-stamped request to every other
process in the system.
RA2: A process receiving a request sends an ack back to the sender, only when (1) the process
is not interested in entering its CS or (2) the process is trying to enter its CS, but its time
stamp is larger than that of the sender. If the process is already in its CS or its timestamp
is smaller than that of the sender, then it will buffer all requests until its exit from CS.
RA3: A process enters its CS, when it receives an ack from each of the remaining (n − 1)
processes.
RA4: Upon exit from its CS, a process must send ack to each of the pending requests
before making a new request or executing other actions.
Intuitively, a process is allowed to enter its CS, only when it receives a go-ahead signal
from every other process, since either these processes are not competing for entry into the
CS or their requests bear a higher time stamp.
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 133
Proof of ME1: Two processes i and j can enter their CSs at the same time, only if both
receive (n − 1) acks. However, per RA2, both i and j cannot send acks to each other, so both
cannot receive (n − 1) acks and thus cannot be in their respective CS at the same time. ◾
Proof of ME2 and ME3: Draw a directed graph G with the processes as nodes. Add an
edge from node i to node j if j is already in its CS or j’s request has a lower time stamp compared
to i’s request. Clearly, G is an acyclic graph. A process i trying to enter its CS is kept
waiting, if there exists at least one other process j such that an edge i → j exists and j will
not send an ack to i until it completes its CS. Per RA3, the process represented by the node
with out-degree 0 will receive all acks and enter its CS (unless it is already in its CS). Upon
exit from its CS, it will send an ack to each of the waiting processes, which will decrement
their out-degrees by 1 (RA4). Therefore, the waiting processes will enter their CSs in the
order defined by their out-degrees. Deadlock is ruled out since G is acyclic, and every waiting
process will enter its CS in a bounded number of steps. ◾
Proof of FIFO fairness: It follows from the proof of ME2 and ME3. If the time stamp of
the request from i < the time stamp of the request from j, then i has a smaller out-degree
than j in the directed acyclic graph G. Therefore, i will enter its CS before j does. This proves
progress as well as FIFO fairness. ◾
Unlike Lamport’s algorithm that explicitly creates consistent explicit local queues,
Ricart and Agrawala’s algorithm implicitly creates an acyclic wait-for chain of processes
i → j → k →⋯ where each process waits for the other processes ahead of it to send an ack.
Note that this algorithm does not require the channels to be FIFO.
To compute the message complexity, note that each process sends (n − 1) requests and
receives (n − 1) acks to complete one trip to its CS. Therefore, the total number of messages
sent by a process to complete one trip into its CS is 2(n − 1). This is less than what was
needed in Lamport’s algorithm.
7.2.3 Maekawa’s Solution
In 1985, Maekawa extended Ricart and Agrawala’s algorithm and suggested the first solution
to the n-process distributed mutual exclusion problem with a message complexity
lower than O(n) per process. The underlying principle is based on the theory of finite projective
planes. As a clear deviation from the strategies adopted in the previous two algorithms,
here, a process i is required to send request messages only to a subset Si of the
processes in the system, and the receipt of acks from each of the processes in this subset Si
is sufficient to allow that process to enter its CS.
Maekawa divides the processes into a number of subsets of identical size K. Each process i is
associated with a unique subset Si. The subsets satisfy the following three properties:
1. ∀i, j:0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1::Si ∩ Sj ≠ ∅
Whenever a pair of processes i and j wants to enter their respective CSs, a process in
Si ∩ Sj takes up the role of an arbitrator and chooses only one of them by sending ack
and defers the other one.
134 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
2. i ∈ Si. It is only natural that a process gets an ack from itself for entering the CS. Note
that this does not cost a message.
3. Every process i is present in the same number (D) of subsets. The fact that every
node acts as an arbitrator for the same number of processes adds to the symmetry
of the system.
As an example, consider the table earlier showing the partition for seven processes numbered
0..6. Here, each set has a size K = 3, and each process is included in D = 3 subsets.
The relationship D = K is not essential, but we will soon find out that it helps in reducing
the message complexity of the system. In the following, we present the first version of
Maekawa’s algorithm (call it maekawa1) that uses five basic rules:
MA1: To enter its CS, a process i first sends a time-stamped request message to every
process in Si.
MA2: A process receiving requests sends an ack to that process whose request has the
lowest time stamp if it is outside its CS. It locks itself to that process and keeps all
other requests waiting in a request queue. If the receiving process is inside its CS,
then it defers this action until it leaves its CS.
MA3: A process i enters its CS when it receives acks from every member of Si.
MA4: During exit from its CS, a process sends release messages to all members of Si.
MA5: Upon receiving a release message from process i, a process unlocks itself, deletes
the current request, and sends an ack to the process whose request has the lowest time
stamp.
Proof of ME1 (by contradiction): Assume that the statement is false and two processes
i and j (i ≠ j) enter their CSs at the same time. For this to happen, every member of Si
must have received the request from i, and every member of Sj must have received the
request from j. Since Si ∩ Sj ≠ ∅, there is a process k ∈ Si ∩ Sj that received requests from
both i and j. Per MA2, process k will send ack to only one of them and refrain from
sending the ack to the other, until the first process has sent a release signal. Since a process
needs an ack from every member of its subset, both i and j cannot enter their CSs
at the same time. ◾
S0 = {0, 1, 2}
S1 = {1, 3, 5}
S2 = {2, 4, 5}
S3 = {0, 3, 4}
S4 = {1, 4, 6}
S5 = {0, 5, 6}
S6 = {2, 3, 6}
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 135
The proposed algorithm maekawa1, however, does not satisfy the safety property ME2,
since there is a potential for deadlock. The source of the problem is that no process is clairvoyant—
so when a process receives a request, it does not know whether another request with
a lower time stamp is on its way. Here is an example. Assume that processes 0, 1, and 2 have
sent request to the members of S0, S1, and S2, respectively. The following scenario is possible:
• From S0 = {0, 1, 2}, processes 0 and 2 send ack to 0, but process 1 sends ack to 1.
• From S1 = {1, 3, 5}, processes 1 and 3 send ack to 1, but process 5 sends ack to 2.
• Prom S2 = {2, 4, 5}, processes 4 and 5 send ack to 2, but process 2 sends ack to 0.
Thus, 0 waits for* 1, 1 waits for 2, and 2 waits for 0. This circular waiting causes deadlock.
There are two possible ways of avoiding a deadlock. The first is to assume a system-wide
order of message propagation, as explained in the following:
(Global FIFO) Every process receives incoming messages in strictly increasing order of
time stamps.
We now demonstrate that if the global FIFO property holds, then algorithm maekawa1
is deadlock-free and satisfies the FIFO fairness requirement.
Proof of ME2 and ME3 (by induction)
Basis: Consider a process i whose request bears the lowest time stamp, and assume that no
process is currently in its CS. Because of the global FIFO assumption, every process in Si
must receive the request from process i before any other request with a higher time stamp.
Therefore, process i will receive ack from every process in Si and will enter its CS.
Induction step: Assume that a process m is already in its CS and the request from process j
has the lowest time stamp among all the waiting processes. We show that process j eventually
receives acks from every process in Sj and proceeds to its CS.
Because of the global FIFO assumption, request from process j is received by every process
in Sj before any other request with a higher time stamp and ordered ahead of every
other process seeking entry into the CS. Therefore, when process m exits the CS and sends
release signals to every process in Sm, every process in Sm ∩ Sj sends ack to process j. In
addition, every process in (¬Sm ∩ Sj) has already sent acks to process j since the request
from process j is at the head of the local queues of these processes. Therefore, process j
eventually receives acks from every process in Sj.
This shows that after process m exits the CS, process j whose request bears the next
higher time stamp eventually enters the CS. It therefore follows that every process sending
a request eventually enters the CS.
The global FIFO property however neither holds in practice nor is easy to implement.
Therefore, Maekawa presented a modified version of his first algorithm (call it maekawa2)
* Here “i waits for j” means that process i waits for process j to send a release message.
136 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
that does not deadlock. This version uses three additional signals: failed, inquire, and relinquish.
The outline of the modified version is as follows:
MA1′: To enter its CS, a process i sends a time-stamped request message to every process
in Si {same as MA1}.
MA2′: A process receiving a request can take one of the following three steps when it is
outside its CS:
• If lock has not yet been set, then the process sends an ack to the requesting process
with the lowest time stamp and sets its own lock to the id of that process.
• If lock is already set and the time stamp of the incoming request is higher than
the time stamp of the locked request, then the incoming request is enqueued and
a failed message is sent to the sender.
• If lock is already set, but the time stamp of the incoming request is lower than that
of the locked request, then the incoming request is queued, and an inquire message
is sent to the sender of the locking request. This message is meant to check
the current status of the process whose request set the lock.
MA3′: When a requesting process i receives acks from every member of Si, it enters its CS.
However, if it receives an inquire message, it checks whether it can go ahead. If it has
already received or subsequently receives at least one failed message, it knows that it
cannot go ahead—so it sends a relinquish message back to the members of Si, indicating
that it wants to give up. Otherwise, it ignores the inquire message.
MA4′: During exit from CS, process i sends release messages to each member of Si (same
as MA4).
MA5′: Upon receiving a release message, a process deletes the currently locked request
from its queue. If the queue is not empty, then it also sends an ack to the process with
the lowest time stamp; otherwise, it resets the lock (same as MA5).
MA6′: Upon receiving a relinquish message, the process sends ack to the waiting process
with the lowest time stamp (but does not delete the current request from its queue)
and sets its lock appropriately.
The same partial correctness proof is applicable to the modified algorithm also. Here is
an informal argument about the absence of deadlock.
Assume that there is a deadlock involving k processes 0, 1, 2, …, k − 1. Without loss of
generality, we assume that process i waits for process (i + 1) mod k. Let the request from
process j bear the lowest time stamp. This means that process j cannot receive a failed message
from any process in Sj. Since process j waits for process (j + 1) mod k, there must exist a
process m ∈ (Si ∩ Sj + 1) that has set its lock to (j + 1) mod k instead of j. When process m later
receives the request from process j, it sends an inquire message to process (j + 1) mod k,
which eventually replies with either a relinquish or a release message. In either case, every
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 137
process belonging to (Sj ∩ Sj+1) eventually locks itself to process j and sends ack to process j.
As a result, the condition “process j waits for (j + 1) mod k” ceases to hold, and the deadlock
is avoided (Figure 7.1).* ◾
Message complexity: Let K be the cardinality of each subset Si. In the first algorithm
maekawa1, each process (1) sends K request messages, (2) receives K acks, and (3) sends K
release messages. When D = K, the relationship between n and K is n = K(K − 1) + 1. A good
approximation is K = n, which leads to the message complexity of 3 = n.
A more precise computation of worst-case complexity for the modified version of
the algorithm can be found in Maekawa’s original paper [M85]. The complexity is still
O = ( n ), but the constant of proportionality is larger.
7.3 TOKEN-PASSING ALGORITHMS
Another class of distributed mutual exclusion algorithms uses the concept of an explicit
variable token that acts as a permit for entry into the CS and can be passed around the
system from one requesting process to another. Whichever process wants to enter its CS
must acquire the token. The first known algorithm belonging to this class is due to Suzuki
and Kasami.
7.3.1 Suzuki–Kasami Algorithm
This algorithm is defined for a completely connected network of processes. It assumes that
initially an arbitrary process has the token. A process i that does not have the token but
wants to enter its CS broadcasts a request (i, num), where num is sequence number of that
request. The algorithm guarantees that eventually process i receives the token.
Every process i maintains an array req[0.. n − 1] of integers, where req[j] designates the
sequence number of the latest request received from process j. Note that although every process
receives a request, only one process (which currently has the token) can grant the token.
* This informal argument echoes the reasoning in the original paper. Sanders [S87] claimed that the modified algorithm
is still prone to deadlock.

it sends an inquire message to 5 to find out if it indeed entered its CS.
138 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
As a result, some pending requests become stale or outdated. An important issue in this
algorithm is to identify and discard these stale requests. To accomplish this, each process
uses the following two additional data structures that are passed on with the token by its
current holder:
• An array last[0.. n − 1] of integers, where last[k] = r implies that during its last visit to
its CS, process k has completed its rth trip
• A queue Q containing the identifiers of processes with pending requests
When a process i receives a request with a sequence number num from process k, it updates
req[k] to max(req[k], num), so that req[k] now represents the most recent request from process
k. A process holding the token must guarantee (before passing it to another process)
that its Q contains the most recent requests. To satisfy this requirement, when a process i
receives a token from another process, it executes the following steps:
• It copies its num into last[i].
• For each process k, process i retains process k’s name in its local queue Q only if
1 + last[k] = req[k] (this establishes that the request from process k is a recent one).
• Process i completes the execution of its CS codes.
• If Q is nonempty, then it forwards the token to the process at the head of Q after deleting
its entry.
To enter the CS, a process sends (n − 1) requests and receives one message containing
the token. The total number of messages required to complete one visit to its CS is thus
(n − 1) + 1 = n. Readers are referred to [SK85] for a proof of this algorithm.
7.3.2 Raymond’s Algorithm
Raymond suggested an improved version of a token-based mutual exclusion algorithm
that works on a network with a tree topology. At any moment, one node holds the token,
and it serves as a root of the tree. Every edge is assigned a direction, so that by following
these directed edges, a request can be sent to that root. If there is a directed edge from i to j,
then j is called the holder of i. As the token moves from one process to another, the root
changes, and so do the directions of the edges (Figure 7.2).

4 make requests in that order; (b) the token is transferred to 1.
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 139
In addition to the variable holder, each node has a local queue Q to store the pending
requests. Only the first request is forwarded to the holder. An outline of Raymond’s algorithm
is presented in the following:
R1: If a node j has the token, then it enters its CS. Otherwise, to enter its CS, a node
enters the request in its local Q.
R2: When a node j (which is not holding the token) has a nonempty request Q, it sends a
request to its holder, unless j has already done so and is waiting for the token.
R3: When the root receives a request, it sends the token to the neighbor at the head of
its local Q after it has completed its own CS. Then, it sets its holder variable to that
neighbor.
R4: Upon receiving a token, a node j forwards it to the neighbor at the head of its local
Q, deletes the request from Q, and sets its holder variable to that neighbor. If there are
pending requests in Q, then j sends another request to its holder.
Since there is a single token in the system, the proof of safety (ME1) is trivial. Deadlock
is impossible (ME2) because the underlying directed graph is acyclic: a process i waits for
another process j only if there is a directed path from i to j, which implies that j does not
wait for i. Finally, fairness follows from the fact that the queues are serviced in the order
of arrival of the requests, and a new request from a process that acquired the token in the
recent past is enqueued behind the remaining pending requests in its local queue.
For a detailed proof of this algorithm, see [R89]. Since the average distance between pairs
of nodes in a randomly generated tree is O(log n), the message complexity of Raymond’s
algorithm is claimed to be O(log n).
7.4 SOLUTIONS ON THE SHARED-MEMORY MODEL
Historically, the bulk of the work in the area of mutual exclusion has been done on
shared-memory models. The Dutch mathematician Dekker was the first to propose a
solution to the mutual exclusion problem using atomic read and write operations on a
shared memory. The requirements of a correct solution on the shared-memory model
are similar to those in the message-passing model, except that fairness is specified
as freedom from livelock or freedom from starvation: no process can be indefinitely prevented
from entering its CS by other processes in the system. This fits the definition of
weak fairness: if a process remains interested in entering into its CS, then it must eventually
be able to do so.
Of the many algorithms available for solving the mutual exclusion problem, we will only
describe Peterson’s algorithm.
7.4.1 Peterson’s Algorithm
Gary Peterson’s solution is considered to be the simplest of all the solutions to the mutual
exclusion problem using atomic read and write operations. We first present his two-process
140 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
solution here. There are two processes: 0 and 1. Each process i has a Boolean variable flag[i]
that can be read by any process, but written by i only. To enter its CS, each process i sets
flag[i] to true. To motivate the readers, we first discuss a naive approach in which each process,
after setting its own flag to true, checks if the flag of the other process has also been set
to true and jumps to a conclusion as summarized in the following:
program naïve;
define flag[0], flag[1]: shared Boolean;
initially both are false;
{process 0 repeats the following forever}
flag[0]:=true;
do flag[1] → skip od;
critical section;
flag[0] := false
{process 1 repeats the following forever}
flag[1] := true
do flag[0] → skip od;
critical section;
flag[1] := false
The solution guarantees safety. However, it is not deadlock-free. If both processes complete
their first steps in succession, then there will be a deadlock in their second steps.
To remedy this, Peterson’s solution uses a shared integer variable turn that can be read
and written by both processes. Since the writing operations on shared variables are atomic,
in the case of a contention (indicated by flag[0] = flag[1] = true), both processes update
turn, and the last write prevails. This delays the CS entry of the process that updated turn
last. The program is as follows:
program peterson;
define flag[0], flag[1] shared Boolean;
turn: shared integer
initially flag[0] = false, flag[1] = false, turn = 0 or 1
{program for process 0}
do true→
1: flag[0] := true;
2: turn := 0;
3: do (flag[1] ∧ turn = 0) → skip od
4: critical section;
5: flag[0] := false;
6: non-critical section codes

9: do (flag[0] ∧ turn = 1) → skip od;
10: critical section;
11: flag[1] := false;
12: non-critical section codes
od
Note that the conditions in step 3 and step 9 need not be evaluated atomically. As a consequence,
when process 0 has checked flag[1] to be true and is reading the value of turn,
flag[1] may be changed to false by process 1 (step 11). It is also possible that process 0 has
checked flag[1] to be false and is entering its CS, but by that time, process 1 has changed
flag[1] to true (step 7). Despite this, the solution satisfies all the correctness criteria introduced
earlier.
Proof of the absence of deadlock (ME2) (by contradiction): Process 0 can potentially
wait in step 3, and process 1 can potentially wait in step 9. We need to show that they
both cannot wait for each other. Suppose they both wait. Then the condition (flag[0] ∧
turn = 1) ∧ (flag[1] ∧ turn = 0) must be true. However, (turn = 1 ∧ turn = 0) = false.
Therefore, deadlock is impossible. ◾
Proof of safety (ME1): Without loss of generality, assume that process 0 is in its CS (step 4).
This must have been possible because in step 3, either flag[1] was false or turn = 1 or both of
these were true. The issue here is to demonstrate that process 1 cannot enter its CS.
To enter its CS, process 1 must read flag[0] as false or turn as 0. Since process 0 is already
in its CS, flag[0] is true, so the value of turn has to be 0. Is this feasible?
Case 1: Process 0 reads flag[1] = false in step 3:
⇒ Process 1 has not executed step 7.
⇒ Process 1 eventually sets turn to 1 (step 8).
⇒ Process 1 checks turn (step 9) and finds turn =1.
⇒ Process 1 waits in step 9 and cannot enter its CS.
Case 2: Process 0 reads turn = 1 in step 3:
⇒ Process 1 executed step 8 after process 0 executed step 2.
⇒ In step 9, process 1 reads flag[0] = true and turn =1.
⇒ Process 1 waits in step 9 and cannot enter its CS. ◾
142 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Proof of progress (ME3): We need to show that once a process sets its flag to true, it
eventually enters its CS. Without loss of generality, assume that process 0 has set flag[0]
to true but is waiting in step 3 since it found the condition (flag[1] ∧ turn = 0) to be true.
If process 1 is in its CS, then eventually in step 11, it sets flag[1] to false and gives an
opportunity to process 1 to enter its CS. If process 0 notices this change, then it enters
its CS. If process 0 does not utilize this opportunity, then subsequently process 1 will
set flag[1] to true (step 6) again for its next attempt for entry to its CS. Eventually it
sets turn = 1 (step 8). This stops process 1 from making any further progress and allows
process 0 to enter its CS. ◾
Peterson generalized his two-process algorithm to a system of n processes (n > 1) as follows:
the program runs for n − 1 rounds—in each round, an instance of the two-process
algorithm is used to prevent at least one process from advancing to the next round, and
the winner after n − 1 rounds enters the CS. Like the two-process solution, the n-process
solution satisfies all the required properties. The program is as follows:
program Peterson n-process;
define flag, turn: array [0.. n − 1] of shared integer;
initially ∀k:flag[k] = 0, and turn = 0
{program for process i}
do true →
1: j:=1;
2: do j ≠ n − 1
3: flag[i] := j;
4: turn[j] := i;
5: do (∃k ≠ i: flag[k] ≥ j ∧ turn[j] = i) → skip od;
6: j := j + 1;

7.5 MUTUAL EXCLUSION USING SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
Since it is not easy to implement shared-memory solutions to the mutual exclusion problem
using read–write atomicity only, many processors include special instructions (with
larger grains of atomicity) to facilitate such implementations. We will discuss two such
implementations here:
7.5.1 Solution Using Test-and-Set
Let x be a shared variable and r be a local or private variable of a process. Then the instruction
TS (r, x) is an atomic operation defined as (r := x; x := 1). Instructions of this type are
known as RMW instructions, as they package three operations: read, modify, and write as
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 143
one indivisible unit. Using TS, the mutual exclusion problem can be solved for n processes
(n > 1) as follows:
program Test-and-set (for any process);
define x: shared integer;
r: integer (private);
initially x = 0, r = 1;
do true →
do r ≠ 0 → TS(r, x) od;
critical section;
x := 0
od
Due to the atomicity property, all TS operations are serialized, the first process that executes
the TS instruction enters its CS. Note that the solution is deadlock-free and safe, but
does not guarantee fairness since a process may be prevented from entering its CS for an
indefinitely long period by other processes.
7.5.2 Solution Using Load-Linked and Store-Conditional
In many multiprocessors, atomic RMW instructions are difficult to implement. An alternative
is to use load-linked (LL) and store-conditional (SC)—these are a pair of special
instructions that achieve process synchronization by using some built-in features of the
cache controllers for bus-based multiprocessors. LL and SC were first used by in the alpha
processor, and similar instructions have since been used in MIPS, PowerPC, and ARM
processors. Unlike TS, LL, and SC are not atomic RMW operations, but they simplify
the implementation of atomic RMW operations and thus can be used to solve the mutual
exclusion problem. If x is a shared integer variable in the memory and r is a private integer
local to a process, then the semantics of LL and SC are as follows:
• LL(r, x) is like a machine instruction load (i.e., r := x). In addition, the system automatically
tracks changes to the address x.
• SC(r, x) is like a machine instruction store (i.e., x := r). However, if the process executing
SC is the first process to do so after the last LL executed by any process, then the store
operation succeeds, and the success is reported by returning a value 1 into r. Otherwise,
the store operation fails, the value of x remains unchanged, and a 0 is returned into r.
The snooping cache controller responsible for maintaining cache coherence helps track
changes to the address x during the LL(r, x) and SC(r, x) operations. In the following, we
present a solution to the mutual exclusion problem using LL and SC:
program mutex (for process i);
define x: shared integer; r: integer (private);
initially x = 0;
144 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
do true →
1: try: do r ≠ 0 → LL(r, x) od; {CS is busy}
2: r = 1; SC(r, x);
3: if r = 0 → goto try fi; {SC did not succeed)
4: critical section;
5: x := 0;
6: non-critical section codes;
7: od
Observe that lines 1–3 essentially implement a TS instruction without blocking the bus for
two consecutive bus cycles. Additionally, such instructions are easier to accommodate in
the instruction set of reduced instruction set computers. Popular processors have adopted
different variations of LL and SC instructions—for example, ARM version 6 and higher
uses LDREX/STREX instructions that work similar to LL/SC.
7.6 GROUP MUTUAL EXCLUSION
The classical mutual exclusion problem has several variations, and group mutual exclusion
is one of them. In this generalization, instead of trying to enter their individual
CSs, processes opt to join one of distinct forums. Group mutual exclusion requires
that at any time, at most, one forum should be in session, but any number of processes
should be able to join the forum at a time. An example is that of a movie theater, where
different people may want to schedule their favorite movies. Here, the forum is the set
of viewers of a certain movie, and the forum is in session when the movie is screened
in the movie theater. The problem was first proposed and solved by Joung in 1999. A
more precise specification of the problem follows: let there be n processes 0.. n − 1 each
of which chooses to be in one of m distinct forums. Then the following four conditions
must hold:
Mutual exclusion: At most, one forum must be in session at any time.
No deadlock: At any time, at least one process should have an eligible action.
Bounded waiting: Every forum that has been chosen by some process must be in session
within a bounded time.
Concurrent entry: Once a forum is in session, concurrent entry into that session is guaranteed
for all willing processes.
The group mutual exclusion problem is a combination of the classical mutual exclusion
problem and the readers and writers problem (inasmuch as multiple readers can
concurrently read a file), but the framework is more general. It reduces to the classical
mutual exclusion problem if each process has its own forum not shared by any other
process.
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 145
A centralized solution: To realize the challenges involved in finding a solution, we first
attempt to solve it using a central coordinator. Let there be only two sessions F and F′.
Each process has a flag ∈ {F, F′, ⊥}, which indicates its preference for the next session.
Here, flag = ⊥ implies that the process is not interested in joining any session. The coordinator
will read the flags of the processes in ascending order from 0 to n − 1 and guarantee
that the first active process always gets entry to its forum, followed by others requesting
the same forum.
The simplistic solution will satisfy all requirements of group mutual exclusion except
that of bounded waiting, since there is a possibility of starvation: when one forum is chosen
to be in session, processes can collude to enter and leave that forum in such a manner that
the other forum is never scheduled.
It is possible to resolve this problem by electing a leader for each forum that is scheduled.
In fact, the very first process that enters a forum is the leader. When the leader leaves
a forum, other processes are denied further entry into that forum. This prevents the processes
joining a forum from monopolizing it.
Let us now study a decentralized solution to this problem.
A decentralized solution: The first version of the decentralized solution proposed by Joung
follows the footsteps of the centralized solution. It works on a shared-memory model. Each
process cycles through the following four states: (request, in_cs, in_forum, passive). Each process
has a flag = (state, op), where state ∈ {request, in_cs, in_forum, passive} and op ∈ {F, F′, ⊥}.
A process trying to join a forum F sets its flag to (request, F) and eventually moves to the in_cs
state that gives it a temporary permit to attempt entry to the forum F. It enters forum F if no
other process is in the in_cs state for the other forum F′. Finally, the process exits forum F
and becomes passive. The solution is shown as follows:
First attempt with two forums F and F′
define flag: array[1..n − 1] of (state, op), turn ∈ {F, F′}
state ∈ {request, in_cs, in_forum, passive}
op ∈ {F, F′, ⊥}
{Program for process i trying to attend forum F}
1 do ∃j ≠ i: flag[j] = (in_cs, F′) →
2 flag[i] := (request, F); {request phase}
3 do turn ≠ F ∧ ¬all_passive(F′) → skip od;
4 flag[i] := (in_cs, F); {in_cs phase}
5 od;
6 attend forum F; {in_forum phase}
7 turn := F′;
8 flag[i] := (passive, ⊥) {passive phase}
The previous program uses the predicate:
all_passive (F′) ≡ ∀j ≠ i: flag[j] = (state, op) ⇒ op ≠ F′
146 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The first version is fair with respect to forums. As in Peterson’s two-process algorithm,
contention is fairly resolved by using a variable turn. Note that reaching the in_cs phase
gives the requesting process a temporary permit—it does not automatically qualify a
process to attend its forum. For this, it also has to make sure that all processes in the
other forum F′ are out of the in_cs state.
The proposed however is not fair with respect to processes: If several processes request a
forum F, then it is guaranteed that at least one of them will succeed, but we don’t know who
will. A process, while infrequently checking the predicate in line 3, may find that between
two consecutive unsuccessful attempts, the forum has changed from F′ to F and then back
to F′, giving it no chance to make progress. Thus, a requesting process may miss out the
requested forum for an indefinite period of time. To make it fair with respect to processes,
Joung’s algorithm uses the idea from the centralized solution by introducing a leader for
every session. Given a forum F, some process will lead others to F. For each process i,
define a variable successor[i] ∈ {F, F′, ⊥} to denote the forum that it is captured to attend
by the leader. The very first process that enters a forum F is the leader of that forum, and
the processes that are captured into F are the successors of the leader. Only a leader can
capture successors. A process k for which successor[k] = F gets direct entry into session F as
long as the leader of F is in session. The permit is withdrawn as soon as the leader quits F.
successor[k] = ⊥ implies that process k is not currently captured. A description of the fair
solution to the group mutual exclusion problem can be found in [J98].
7.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
There are different metrics for evaluating the performance of mutual exclusion algorithms.
In message-passing solutions, only the number of messages required to enter the
CS is emphasized. For shared-memory systems, a metric is the maximum number of steps
(atomic read or write operations) that a process takes to enter its CS in the absence of contention.
Fairness is determined by the maximum number of other processes that may enter
their CSs between two consecutive CS entries by a given process. To satisfy the progress
property (ME3), this number has to be finite.
In message-passing solutions, using time stamps to determine the order of requests, the
size of the logical clock (or the sequence number) can become unbounded. In [RA81], Ricart
and Agrawala addressed the question of bounding the size of the logical clock. Assuming
that the logical clock values are not incremented by any event outside the mutual exclusion
algorithm, they argued that with n processes, the maximum difference between two different
time stamps cannot exceed (n − 1). Therefore, it is adequate to increment the logical
clock in the mod M field, where M = 2n − 1, since it will resolve without ambiguity whether
a time stamp is ahead or behind another time stamp.
In token-based algorithms, once a process acquires the token, it can enter the CS as
many times as it wants unless it receives a request from another process. While reusing a
permit is sometimes criticized as undemocratic, this reduces the message complexity when
some processes access their CSs more often than others.
Mutual Exclusion ◾ 147
Shared-memory solutions to the mutual exclusion problem using read–write atomicity
proved to be a fertile area of research and have been extensively studied. Joung’s group
mutual exclusion problem [J98] added a new twist to this problem by allowing a number of
processes interested in the same forum to concurrently enter their CSs. This is relevant for
computer-supported cooperative work.
Computer architects however decided to make the CS algorithms less painful by introducing
special instructions in the instruction set. In addition to TS and (LL, SC) discussed
in this chapter, there are other instructions like compare-and-swap (CAS) or fetch-and-add
(FA) to facilitate process synchronization. A well-known software construct for process
synchronization is semaphore. A semaphore s is a nonnegative shared integer variable that
allows two atomic operations: P(s) ≡ 〈s > 0 → s: = s − 1〉 and V(s) ≡ 〈s: = s + 1〉. Semaphores
can be implemented using atomic read–write operations or more easily using special
instructions like TS or CAS or LL/SC.
In both shared-memory and message-passing solutions to mutual exclusion, a desirable
property is that no process that is outside its CS should influence the entry of another process
into its CS. As a consequence, the following n-process solution (on the shared-memory
model) is considered unacceptable:
program round-robin (for process i}
define turn ∈ {0.. n − 1}
do true →
do turn ≠ i → skip od;
critical section;
turn := turn + 1 mod n;
non-critical section
od
This is because if process 0 wants to enter its CS more frequently than process 1 through
n − 1, then process 0 may have to wait even if no process is in its CS, because each of the
slower processes 1 through n − 1 has to take their turn to enter CS. Despite this, some practical
networks use similar ideas to implement mutual exclusion. An example is the token
ring. The acceptability hinges on the fact that a process not willing to use its turn promptly
passes the token to the next process, minimizing latency.
7.8 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Dijkstra presented the mutual exclusion problem in [D65] where he first described
Dekker’s two-process solution on the shared-memory model and then generalized it to
n processes. His solution was not starvation-free. The first known solution that satisfied
the progress property was due to Knuth [K66]. Peterson’s algorithm [P81] is the simplest
two-process algorithm on the shared-memory model. His technique for generalization
148 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
to the n-process case is applicable to the generalization of other two-process algorithms
too. The bakery algorithm was first presented by Lamport in [L74] and later improved
in [L79]. It is the only known algorithm that solves the mutual exclusion problem without
assuming read–write atomicity—that is, when a read overlaps with a write, the read
is allowed to return any value, but still the algorithm works correctly. However, the
unbounded nature of the shared variable poses a practical limitation. Ben-Ari’s book
[B82] contains a description of several well-known shared-memory algorithms for
mutual exclusion.
Lamport’s message-passing algorithm for mutual exclusion is described in [L78]; Ricart
and Agrawala’s algorithm can be found in [RA81]—a small correction was reported later.
Carvalho and Roucairol [CR83] suggested an improvement of [RA81] that led to a message
complexity between 0 and 2(n − 1). Maekawa’s algorithm appears in [M85], and it
is the first such algorithm with sublinear message complexity. Sanders [S87] presented
a general framework for all message-based mutual exclusion algorithms. Suzuki and
Kasami’s algorithm [SK85] was developed in 1981, but due to editorial problems, its publication
was delayed until 1985. Raymond’s algorithm [R89] is the first algorithm with a
message complexity of O(log n).
Joung [J98] introduced the group mutual exclusion problem. Hennessy and Patterson’s
book [HP11] contains a summary of various synchronization primitives used by historical
and contemporary processors on shared-memory architectures.
EXERCISES
7.1 In Ricart–Agrawala’s distributed mutual exclusion algorithm, show that processes
enter their CSs in the order of their request time stamps even if the channels are
not FIFO.
7.2 The L-exclusion problem is a generalized version of the mutual exclusion problem
in which up to L processes (L ≥ 1) are allowed to be in their CSs simultaneously.
Precisely, if fewer than L processes are in the CS at any time and one more process
wants to enter its CS, then it must be allowed to do so. Modify Ricart–Agrawala’s
algorithm to solve the L-exclusion problem.
7.3 Consider running Maekawa’s algorithm on a system of 13 processes. Figure out the
composition of the 13 subsets S0−S12, so that (1) each subset includes four processes,
(2) there are exactly four subsets, and (3) process i ∈ Si.
7.4 In the Suzuki–Kasami algorithm, prove the liveness property that any process requesting
a token eventually receives the token. Also compute an upper bound on the number
of messages exchanged in the system before the token is received.
7.5 In a network of processes, the local mutual exclusion problem guarantees that no
two neighbors execute a critical action at the same time. Extend Ricart–Agrawala’s
mutual exclusion algorithm to solve the local mutual exclusion problem.

Distributed Snapshot
8.1 INTRODUCTION
A computation is a sequence of atomic actions that transform a given initial state to the
final state. While such actions are totally ordered in a sequential process, they are only
partially ordered in a distributed system. It is customary to reason about the properties of
a program in terms of states and state transitions.
In this context, the state (also known as global state or configuration) of a distributed
system is the set of local states of all the component processes as well as the states of every
channel through which messages flow. Since the local physical clocks are never perfectly
synchronized, the components of a global state can never be recorded at the same time. In
asynchronous distributed systems, actions are not related to time. So the important question
is as follows: When or how do we record the states of the processes and the channels?
Depending on when the states of the individual components are recorded, the value of the
global state can vary widely.
The difficulty can be best explained using a simple example. Consider a system of three
processes numbered 0, 1, and 2 connected by FIFO channels (Figure 8.1), and assume that
an unknown number of indistinguishable tokens are circulating indefinitely through this
network. We want the processes to cooperate with one another to count the exact number
of tokens circulating in the system (without ever stopping the system). The task has
to be initiated by an initiator process (say process 0) that will send query messages to the
other processes to record the number of tokens sighted by them. Consider the case when
there is exactly one token, and let ni denote the number of tokens recorded by process i. In
Figure 8.1, depending on when the individual processes count the tokens, each of the following
situations is possible:
Possibility 1: Process 0 records n0 = 1 when it receives the token. When process 1 records
n1, assume that the token is in channel (1, 2), so n1 = 0. When process 2 records n2, the
token is in channel (2, 0), so n2 = 0. Therefore, n0 + n 1 + n2 = 1.
154 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Possibility 2: Process 0 records n0 = 1 when it receives the token. Process 1 records n1 when
the token has reached process 1, so n1 = 1. Finally, process 2 records n2 when the token
has reached process 2, so n2 = 1. Thus, n0 + n1 + n2 = 3. Since tokens are indistinguishable,
no process knows that the same token has been counted three times!
Possibility 3: Process 0 records n0 = 0 since the token is in channel (0, 1) at the time of
recording. When processes 1 and 2 want to record the count, the tokens have already
left them, so n1 = 0 and n2 = 0. Thus, n0 + n 1 + n2 = 0.
Clearly, possibilities 2 and 3 reflect incorrect views of the global state. How can we devise a
scheme that always records a correct or a consistent view of the global state? In this chapter,
we address this question.
The recording of the global state may look simple for some external observer who looks
at the system from outside. The same problem is surprisingly challenging, when one takes
a snapshot from inside the system. In addition to the intellectual challenge, there are many
interesting applications of this problem. Some examples are as follows:
Deadlock detection: Any process that does not have an eligible action for a prolonged
period would like to find out if the system has reached a deadlock configuration. This
requires the recording of the global state of the system.
Termination detection: Many computations run in phases. In each phase, every process
executes a set of actions. When every process completes all the actions belonging to
phase i and there is no message in transit, phase i terminates and the next phase (i + 1)
begins. To begin a new phase, a process must therefore know whether the computation
in the previous phase has terminated.
System reset or rollback: In case of a malfunction or a loss of coordination, a distributed
system will need to roll back to a consistent global state and initiate a
recovery.
Previous snapshots may be used to define the point from which recovery
should begin.
To understand the meaning of a consistent snapshot state, we will take a look at some of its
important properties.

8.2 PROPERTIES OF CONSISTENT SNAPSHOTS
A critical examination of the three possibilities in Section 8.1 will lead to a better understanding
of what is meant by a consistent snapshot state. Recall that in the absence of a
global clock, concurrency implies the absence of a causal order (Section 3.6). A snapshot
state SSS consists of a set of local states, where each local state is the outcome of a recording
event that follows a send, or a receive, or an internal action. The important notion here is
that of a consistent cut.
8.2.1 Cuts and Consistent Cuts
A cut is a set of events—it contains at least one event per process. Draw a timeline for every
process in a distributed system, and represent events by points on the timeline as shown
in Figure 8.2. Here, {c, d, f, g, h} is a cut. A cut is called consistent if for each event that it
contains, it also includes all events causally ordered before that event. Let a and b be two
events in a distributed system. Then,
(aconsistent cut C)(b a)bC
Thus, for a message m, if the state following receive(m) belongs to a consistent cut, then
the state following send(m) also must belong to that cut. Of the two cuts in Figure 8.2,
Cut 1 = {a, b, c, m, k} is consistent, but Cut 2 = {a, b, c, d, g, m, e, k, i} is not, since (g ∈ Cut 2) ∧
(h ≺ g) but (h ∉ Cut 2). As processes make progress, new events update the consistent cut.
The progress of a distributed computation can be visualized as the forward movement of
the frontier (the latest events) of a consistent cut.
The set of local states following the most recent events (an event a is a most recent
event if there is no other event b such that a ≺ b) of a cut defines a snapshot. A consistent
cut induces a correct or consistent distributed snapshot, that is, the set of local states following
the recorded events of a consistent cut form a correct or consistent distributed
snapshot.

edges represent message transmission.
156 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
In a distributed system, many consistent snapshots can be recorded. A snapshot that is
often of practical interest is the one that is most recent. Let C1 and C2 be two consistent cuts
leading to two different snapshots S1 and S2, respectively, and let C1 ⊂ C2. Then, C2 is more
recent than C1, and snapshot S2 is more recent than snapshot S1.
A computation (also called a behavior or a run) is a sequence of events in a distributed
system. Let a and b be a pair of events in a computation. Then, the computation is consistent
when ∀a,b: a ≺ b ⇒ a precedes b in it. Such a computation reflects one of the feasible
schedules
of a central scheduler. When the events are partially ordered, there may be multiple
consistent runs. Given a consistent run X that contains a pair of concurrent events
c and d, another consistent run Y can be generated from X by swapping their order and
without violating any other causal order in the system.
Chandy and Lamport [CL85] addressed the issue of consistent snapshot and presented
an algorithm for recording such a snapshot. The following section describes their
algorithm.
8.3 CHANDY–LAMPORT ALGORITHM
Let the topology of a distributed system be represented by strongly connected graph. Each
node represents a process and each directed edge represents a FIFO channel. The snapshot
algorithm is superposed on the underlying application and is noninvasive inasmuch as it
does not influence the underlying computation in any way. Note that temporarily freezing
the entire system, taking a snapshot, and then restarting the system are not options, since
freezing a nontrivial distributed system that provides a service is costly and impractical.
A process called the initiator initiates the distributed snapshot algorithm. Any process
can be an initiator. The initiator process sends a special message, called a marker (*)
that prompts other processes in the system to record their states. The markers are for
instrumentation
only—they neither force a causal order among events nor influence the
semantics of the underlying computation in any way. The global state consists of the states
of the processes as well as the channels. However, channels are passive entities—so the
responsibility of recording the state of a channel lies with the process on which the channel
is incident.
For the convenience of explanation, we will use the colors white and red with the different
processes. Initially, every process is white. When a process receives the marker, it turns
red if it has not already done so. Furthermore, every action executed by a process or every
message sent by a process gets the color of that process, so both actions and messages can
be red or white (Figure 8.3). The markers are used for instrumentation only and do not
have any color. There are two actions in this algorithm as described in the following.
DS1: The initiator process, in one atomic action, does the following:
• Turns red
• Records its own state
• Sends a marker along all its outgoing channels
Distributed Snapshot ◾ 157
DS2: Every process, upon receiving a marker for the first time and before doing anything
else, does the following in one atomic action:
• Turns red
• Records its state
• Sends markers along all its outgoing channels
The state of a channel (p, q) is recorded as follows: let sent(p) denote the set of messages
sent by process p along (p, q) and receive(q) denote the set of messages received by process q
via (p, q). Then the state of the channel is recorded as sent(p)\receive(q). Here, sent(p) and
received(q) are locally recorded by the processes p and q, respectively. The snapshot
algorithm
terminates, when
• Every process has turned red
• Every process has received a marker through each of its incoming channels and sent
a marker along each of its outgoing channels
The individual processes only record the fragments of a snapshot state SSS. It requires
another phase of activity to collect these fragments and construct a composite view of SSS.
Global state collection is not a part of the snapshot algorithm.
While the initiator turns red at the very beginning of the snapshot taking process, every
other process changes its color from white to red is due to the arrival of the first marker.

message; R, red message; and the star represents a marker.
158 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Red processes do not change their colors to white during the lifetime of the algorithm. The
following lemma is the cornerstone of the algorithm:
Lemma 8.1
No red message is received by a white action.
Proof: Before a process p receives a red message from a process q along a channel (p, q),
process q must have turned red and sent a marker to p along channel (p, q) (see DS2). Since
the channels are FIFO, the receiving process p must have received that marker and turned
red in the mean time. Thus, the receive action by the process p cannot be white. ◾
If all processes changed colors simultaneously, then the snapshot state SSS would have
been determined by the states of all the processes just after this transition point. However,
due to signal propagation delays, that is never the case. A reasonable alternative to this would
be to record a sequence of white and red actions by all the processes, so that all white actions
precede all red actions (Figure 8.4a). Here, SSS will correspond to the states of the processes
after the last white actions and the first red actions by the processes.
There is however no
guarantee that an observer will be able to observe the actions in this sequence. In reality, an
observer will record the last white actions and the first red actions of the processes in some
order, as in Figure 8.4b. For each process i in an observed sequence, w(i) must precede r(i),
since a causal order exists between them. Note that (a) markers do not change the state of a
process, and (b) white messages received by white processes or red messages received by red
processes are not interesting in the context of the present problem.

view via number of swap actions.
Distributed Snapshot ◾ 159
We will now show that the snapshot state recorded using DS1 and DS2 is indeed equivalent
to the ideal view of Figure 8.4a. The equivalence hinges on the fact that a pair of actions
(a, b) can be observed or scheduled in any order, as long as there is no causal order between
them—so schedule (a, b) is equivalent to schedule (b, a). Now, the main theorem follows.
Theorem 8.1
The Chandy–Lamport algorithm records a consistent global state.
Proof: The snapshot algorithm records a state SSS′ that consists of the states of every process
when it turned red. Let w(i) and r(i) denote, respectively, the last white action and the
first red action by process i. Without loss of generality, assume that an observer records the
following partial schedule of actions (see Figure 8.4b) with processes i, j, k, l, …:
w(i)w(k) r(k)w(j) r(i)w(l) r(j) r(l)…
Call it a break, when a red action precedes a white action in a given schedule. The ideal view
of the schedule (Figure 8.4a) has zero breaks, but in general, the number of breaks in the
recorded sequence of actions can be a positive integer.
By Lemma 8.1, process j cannot receive a red message from process k in a white action, so
there is no causal ordering between actions r(k) and w(j), and these actions can be swapped
to produce an equivalent schedule. But this swap reduces the number of breaks by 1. It thus
follows that in a finite number of swaps, the number of breaks in the equivalent schedule
will be reduced to zero, and the resulting schedule will correspond to the ideal view of
Figure 8.4. Therefore, the recorded state SSS′ is equivalent to a consistent snapshot SSS. ◾
8.3.1 Two Examples
To study various features of the Chandy–Lamport algorithm, we present two examples of
computing the global state.
8.3.1.1 Example 1: Counting of Tokens
Consider Figure 8.1 again. Assume that that only token is in transit in the channel (0, 1) and
process 0 initiates the snapshot algorithm. Then, the following is a valid sequence of events:
1. Process 0 turns red; records n0 = 0, |sent(0, 1)| = 1, and |received(2, 0)| = 0; and sends
the marker along (0, 1).
2. Process 1 receives the token and forwards it along (1, 2) before receiving the marker.
Then, it receives the marker; turns red; records n1 = 0, |received(0, 1)| = 1, and
|sent(1, 2)| = 1; and sends the marker along (1, 2).
3. Process 2 receives the token and forwards it along (2, 0) before receiving the marker.
Then, it receives the marker; turns red; records n2 = 0, |received(1, 2)| = 1, and
|sent(2, 0)| = 1; and forwards the marker to process 0.
4. Process 0 receives the token and then receives the marker along (2, 0). The algorithm
terminates here.
160 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The total number of tokens recorded is as follows: (n0 + n1 + n2) + (|sent(0, 1)| −
|received(0, 1)|) + (|sent(1, 2)| − |received(1, 2)|) + (|sent(2, 0)| − |received(2, 0)|) = 1.
This is consistent with the expected outcome.
8.3.1.2 Example 2: Communicating State Machines
This example is from [CL85]. Two state machines i and j communicate with each
other by sending messages M and M′ along channels c1 and c2 (Figure 8.5), respectively.
Each state machine has two states: up and down. Let s(i) and s(j) denote the
states of i and j, respectively,
and S0 represent the initial global state s(i) = s(j) = down
and c1 = c2 = ∅. A possible sequence of global states is shown in Figure 8.5. The global
state returns to S0 after machine j receives M, so that S0, S1, S2, S3, S0 forms a cyclic
sequence.
Now, use the Chandy–Lamport algorithm to record a snapshot SSS. Assume that in
global state S0, process i initiates the snapshot algorithm by sending a marker and then
sending a message M along c1, which changes s(i) from down to up. Before M reaches
j, state machine j sends M′ along c2, changing s(j) from down to up. Then, j receives
the marker and forwards it along c2. Thereafter, message M′ and then the marker reach

leads to a following recording:

Accordingly, SSS ≡ s(i) = down, c1 = ∅, s(j) = up, c2 = M′.
Notice something unusual here: the snapshot state SSS does not belong to the cycle of
states, so the system was never in that state! What good is a distributed snapshot if the
system never reaches the resulting snapshot state?
To understand the significance of the recorded snapshot state, look at the partial history
of the system (Figure 8.6). The behavior considered in our example is an infinite sequence
of S0S1S2S3S0…, but other behaviors are equally possible. In fact, the recorded snapshot
state SSS corresponds to the state S1′ that is reachable from the initial state S0, although
this behavior was not observed in our example! Additionally, state S3 that was a part of the
observed behavior is reachable from the recorded snapshot state S1′.
It follows from Figure 8.6 that if we could alter the course of the computation so that
(j receives M′) precedes (i receives M), then the recorded state would be reachable from the
initial state S0. The unpredictability of the scheduling order of concurrent actions led to
the anomaly. This is in tune with the swapping argument used in the proof of Theorem 8.1.

FIGURE 8.6 A partial history of the system in Figure 8.5.
162 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The colors of the four actions in the state transitions S0→S1→S2→S3→S0 are r(i), w(j), r(i), r(j),
respectively. Using the notions of equivalent computation, this can be transformed into a
sequence w(j), r(i), r(i), r(j) (by swapping the first two actions since by Lemma 8.1, no red
message can be received in a white action). This alters the computation to S0→S1′→S2→S3→S0,
and the recorded global state SSS will indeed be the same as S1′. These observations can be
summarized as follows:
CL1: Every snapshot state recorded by the Chandy–Lamport algorithm is reachable from
the initial state through a feasible sequence of actions. However, there is no guarantee
that this state will actually be attained during a particular computation.
CL2: Every final state that is reachable from the initial state is also reachable from the
recorded snapshot state through a feasible sequence of actions.
Due to the second property, a malfunctioning distributed system can be reset to a consistent
snapshot state SSS without altering the future course of the distributed system.
Following such a reset action, the system has the potential to catch up with the expected
behavior via a feasible sequence of actions.
Despite such anomalies, SSS indeed represents the actual global state, when the final
state of the system corresponds to a stable predicate. A predicate P is called stable if once
P becomes true, it remains true thereafter. This is different from nonstable predicates that
may be true at a certain time, but change to false thereafter. Some examples of stable predicates
are as follows: (1) the system is deadlocked and (2) the computation has terminated.
8.4 LAI–YANG ALGORITHM
Lai and Yang [LY87] proposed a modification of Chandy–Lamport’s algorithm for distributed
snapshot on a network of processes where the channels need not be FIFO. To understand
Lai and Yang’s modification, let us once again color the messages white and red: a
message is white if it is sent by a process that has not recorded its state, and a message is red
if the sender has already recorded its state. However, unlike Chandy–Lamport’s algorithm,
there are no markers—processes record their local states spontaneously and append this
information as a Boolean flag (red or white) with any message they send. We will represent a
message by (m, c) where m is the underlying message and c is the Boolean flag red or white.
The cornerstone of the algorithm is the condition Lemma 8.1: no red message is received
in a white action. To make it possible, if a process that has not recorded its local state
receives a message (m, red) from another process that has done so, then it first records its
own state (this changes its color to red and the color of all its subsequent actions to red) and
then accepts the message. No other action is required to make the global state consistent.
The algorithm can be stated as follows:
LY1: The initiator records its own state. When it needs to send a message m to another
process, it sends (m, red).
LY2: When a process receives a message (m, red), it first records its state if it has not
already done so and then accepts the message m.
Distributed Snapshot ◾ 163
The approach is lazy inasmuch as processes do not send or use any control message for
the sake of recording a consistent snapshot—the activity rides the wave of messages of the
underlying algorithm. The good thing is that if a complete snapshot is taken, then it will
be consistent. However, there is no guarantee that a complete snapshot will eventually be
taken: if a process i wants to detect termination, then i will record its own state following its
last action, but send no message, so other process may not record their states! To guarantee
that eventually a complete and consistent snapshot is taken, dummy control messages may
be used to propagate the information that some process has already recorded its state.
8.5 DISTRIBUTED DEBUGGING
A common problem of interest in the design and analysis of many distributed systems is to
decide whether the global state will ever satisfy a predefined predicate ϕ. Such a question
may have safety implications: for example, in an industrial control system, a state in which
certain parameters attain predefined values can potentially lead to a hazard. In a traffic
control network, certain combination of traffic signal values can lead to traffic congestion
or a potential collision between vehicles. In a network protocol, certain global states may
cause a safety breach. Observing and analyzing such potential threats are challenging due
to two reasons: (1) the size of the state space of even a small-sized distributed system can
be enormous and (2) the inherent nondeterminism prevents us from freely exploring the
state space. Ideally, to identify a bug, any execution leading the system to the buggy state
must be repeatable. Nondeterminism prevents us from exercising that kind of control in
state exploration. Note that debugging encompasses both stable and unstable predicates.
The history of a distributed system can be represented by a lattice as shown in Figure 8.7.
Assume that there is an observer (also called a monitor) who is observing the computations
in the system. An observer is an external process* that receives notifications from every
internal process (about the next state) whenever they execute an action. The observer has

the following tasks: (1) determine which set of local states form a consistent snapshot, and
construct the lattice of consistent states and (2) figure out if the predicate ϕ(S) = true for
one or more snapshot states S.
8.5.1 Constructing the State Lattice
For this task, we use vector time stamps. Each event is labeled with its vector clock. Each process
reports these events, along with their local sequence numbers and vector time stamps,
to the monitor. The monitor receives them in some arbitrary order. In a set of n processes
V = {0, 1, 2, …, n − 1}, let VC(ei) be the vector time stamp of event ei in process i leading
to its
local state s(i) and VC(ej) be the vector time stamp of event ej in process j leading to its local
state s(j). Then, s(i) and s(j) belong to some consistent global state iff one of them is (0, 0), or
i, j V :VCi (ei )VCi (e j )
Using this criterion, the monitor threads together a set of consistent global states as the
nodes of a lattice. It also identifies the global state transitions by defining an edge from
global state S to S′ iff S′ can be reached from S via a single action by some process. Figure 8.7
illustrates an example: part (a) shows a pair of communicating processes updating a pair
of variables x and y and part (b) shows the corresponding state lattice. Cut 2 is consistent
because the time stamps (3, 0) (of event e0 from process 0) and (0, 1) (of event e1 from process
1) satisfy the conditions VC0(e0) ≥ VC0(e1) and VC1(e1) ≥ VC1(e0). Cut 1 is inconsistent
since VC(e0) = (1, 0) and VC(e1) = (3, 2), which means VC0(e0) < VC0(e1). Inconsistent global
states are excluded from the lattice.
Any traversal from the initial state S00 via the directed edges of the lattice defines a feasible
computation. In the context of these computations, we evaluate the predicates of interest.
8.5.2 Evaluating Predicates
For debugging, let ϕ be a predicate of interest. Three kinds of queries about ϕ are often
considered useful—possibly ϕ, definitely ϕ, and never ϕ:
Possibly ϕ: For a system, “possibly ϕ” holds if there exists at least one consistent global
state S that is reachable from the initial global state, such that ϕ(S) = true. This means
that if there are many observers, then at least one of them may observe ϕ, although
many others may not be able to observe it.
Definitely ϕ: This is different from “definitely ϕ” that signifies that all computations from
the given initial state pass through some consistent global state S for which ϕ(S) = true.
This means every observer must be able to observe ϕ. Clearly, definitely ϕ ⇒ possibly ϕ.
Never ϕ: For a system, the predicate “never ϕ” is true if no computation from the given
initial state passes through a consistent global state S for which ϕ(S) = true.
In Figure 8.7, let ϕ ≡ x + y = 12. This predicate is true only at the global state S21 (i.e., after
the second event of process 0 and the first event of process 1). Since there exists at least one
Distributed Snapshot ◾ 165
computation (but not all) that passes through S21, the condition possibly ϕ holds. However,
for another predicate ϕ ≡ x + y > 15, the stronger condition definitely ϕ holds, since ϕ is
true in global state S32 and all computations pass through this S32. Finally, for the predicate
ϕ ≡ x = y = 5, the condition never ϕ holds since none of the two global states S40 and S22 for
which the predicate holds is consistent.
Distributed debugging using this approach uses a thorough state exploration that has
a large time complexity—with n processes each having m actions, the time complexity of
debugging is O(mn). Thus, scalability is a concern.
8.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The distributed snapshot algorithm clarifies what constitutes the global state of a distributed
system when the clocks are not synchronized or processes do not have clocks. Several
incorrect algorithms for distributed deadlock detection in the published literature have
been attributed to the lack of understanding of the consistency of a global state.
An alternative suggestion is to freeze the entire system, record the states of the processes,
and then resume the computation. However, a global freeze interferes with the ongoing computation
and is not acceptable in most applications. Additionally, any algorithm for freezing
the entire system requires the propagation of a freeze signal across the system and will be handled
in a manner similar to the marker. The state recording algorithm should wait for all the
computations to freeze and all the channels to be empty, which will rely upon a termination
detection phase. Clearly, this alternative is inferior to the solution proposed in this chapter.
The snapshot algorithm captures the fragments of a consistent global state in the various
component processes. It requires another broadcast algorithm (or state collection algorithm)
to put these fragments together into a consistent global state and store it in the state
space of the initiator.
8.7 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Chandy–Lamport algorithm is described in [CL85]. In a separate note [D84], Dijkstra analyzed
this algorithm and provided an alternative method of reasoning about the correctness.
The proof presented here is based on Dijkstra’s note. The algorithm due to Lai and
Yang appears in [LY87]. Mattern’s article [M89] summarizes several snapshot algorithms
and some improvisations. Marzullo and Neiger [MN91] proposed the monitor-based
approach for distributed debugging.
EXERCISES
8.1 Consider the Chandy–Lamport distributed snapshot algorithm running on a network
whose topology is G = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes representing processes and E
is the set of directed edges (representing channels) connecting pairs of processes. Let
n = |V|. Prove that in the snapshot the states of (n – 1) channels will always be empty.
Also, compute the message complexity when G is strongly connected.

propagation delays are known. Suggest an alternative algorithm for computing a
distributed
snapshot based on the physical clock and the channel delays.
8.6 (Programming exercise) Sunrise Bank wants to find out its cash reserve, so it initiates
an audit in all of its branches. At any moment, a sum of money may be in transit from
one branch of the bank to another. ATM transactions, customer transactions through
bank tellers, and interbranch transactions are the only possible types of transactions.
Define two teller processes T1 and T2 at two different branches and three ATM
processes A1, A2, and A3, each with a predefined amount of cash. Assume that four
customers have an initial balance of a certain amount in their checking accounts. Each
user can deposit money into or withdraw money from their accounts through any ATM
or a teller. In addition, any customer can transfer an amount of available cash from her
account to any other customer, some of which may lead to interbranch transfers.
Use Lai–Yang algorithm to conduct an audit of Sunrise Bank. Allow the users to
carry out transactions at an arbitrary instant of time. The audit must reveal that at
any moment, total cash = initial balance + credit − debit regardless of when and where
users transact money.
8.7 While distributed snapshot is a mechanism for reading the global state of a system,
there are occasions when the global state is to be reset to a new value. An example is a
failure or a coordination loss in the system. As with the snapshot algorithms, we rule
out the use of freezing the network.
Explore if the Chandy–Lamport algorithm can be adapted for this purpose by
replacing all reads by writes. Thus, when a process receives a marker, it will first reset
its state and then send out the marker in one indivisible action.

part of this project, you have to measure the maximum number of messages that in

of making it a two-phase process, explore the possibility of computing the global state

Assume that the topology is strongly connected and the edges represent FIFO
channels. The initiator will send out a mobile agent with a briefcase that will store
its data. The briefcase has a variable S—it is an array of the local states of the various
processes. Before the agent is launched, ∀i: S[i] = undefined. At the end, the agent will
return to the initiator, and S will represent a consistent global state (Figure 8.9).

Global State Collection
9.1 INTRODUCTION
In a distributed system, each process executes actions on the basis of local information that
consists of its own state and the states of its neighbors or messages through the incoming
channels. Many applications need to find out the global state of the system by collecting the
local states of the component processes. These include
• Computation of the network topology
• Counting the number of processes in a distributed system
• Detecting termination
• Detecting deadlock
• Detecting loss of coordination
The distributed snapshot algorithm (Chapter 8) clarifies the notion of a consistent
global state and helps record the fragments of a consistent global state into the local
state spaces of the individual processes but does not address the task of collecting these
fragments. In this chapter, we address this issue and present several algorithms for
global state collection.
The algorithms for global state collection have been classified into various types: probeecho,
wave or PIF algorithm, heartbeat algorithm, etc. The classification is usually based
on the mechanism used to collect the states, and the classes are not mutually exclusive.
For example, wave algorithms refer to a class of computations, in which an initiator starts
a computation that triggers more actions in the adjacent noninitiator nodes, and in a
bounded time, each node in the system reaches local termination when a predefined goal
is reached. The resulting causal chain of events resembles the growth and decay of waves in
a still pond—hence the name wave algorithm.
170 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
We will study a few algorithms that follow the various paradigms without paying much
attention to the class to which they belong. We begin with the description and correctness
proof of an elementary broadcasting algorithm, where the underlying message-passing
model supports point-to-point communication only.
9.2 ELEMENTARY ALGORITHM FOR ALL-TO-ALL BROADCASTING
Consider a strongly connected network of n processes 0, 1, 2,…, n−1. Each process i has a
stable value s(i) associated with it. The goal is to devise an algorithm by which every process
i can broadcast its value s(i) to every other process in this system, so that at the end,
each process i will have a set Vi = {s(k): 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1} of values. We will use a messagepassing
model.
Initially, ∀i:Vi = s(i). To complete the broadcast, every process i will periodically (1) send
its current Vi to each of its outgoing channels and (2) receive the values from its incoming
channels to update Vi. A naive approach for broadcasting is flooding, where each
process sends its value to all neighbors, the neighbors send that value to their neighbors,
and so on. This approach is very inefficient in terms of message complexity, and controlling
the termination is also a matter of concern. The following algorithm addresses both
these issues.
To save unnecessary work, it makes little sense to send Vi, if it has not changed
since the last send operation. Furthermore, even if Vi has changed since the last send
operation, it suffices to send the incremental change only—this will keep the message
size small.
To accomplish this, we associate two sets of values with each process i—the set Vi will
denote the current set of values collected so far, and the set Wi will represent the last value
of Vi sent along the outgoing channels so far. Let (i, j) represent the channel from process i
to process j. The algorithm terminates when no process receives any new value and every
channel is empty. The program for process i is given as follows:
program broadcast (for process i}
define Vi, Wi: set of values;
initially Vi = {s(i)}, Wi = Ø {and every channel is empty}
1 do Vi ≠ Wi → send Vi\Wi to every outgoing channel;
Wi:= Vi
2 [] ¬empty (k,i) → receive X from channel (k,i);
Vi:= Vi ∪ X
od
Correctness proof
To prove the correctness, we first establish partial correctness and then prove termination.
For partial correctness, we demonstrate that when all the guards are false, every process
must have collected the value s(i) from every other process i.
Global State Collection ◾ 171
Lemma 9.1
empty(i, k) ⇒ Wi ⊆ Vk
Proof (by induction):
Basis: Initially, Wi = ∅ and Vi = s(i), so Wi ⊆ Vk holds.
Induction hypothesis: Assume Wi ⊆ Vk holds after process i executes the first statement
r times and channel (i, k) becomes empty. We will show that Wi ⊆ Vk holds after process
i executes the first statement (r + 1) times and (i, k) becomes empty.
Induction step: Between two consecutive executions of statement 1, statement 2 must be
executed at least once. Let Vi W
r
i
r , denote the value of Vi and Wi after process i executes
statement 1 r times. After process i executes statement 1 for the (r + 1)th time,
the set of messages sent down the channel (i, k) Vi \W
r

= +1 r (Figure 9.1).
When every message in (i, k) is received by process k (statement 2), channel (i, k) becomes
empty. This implies that Vi W V

Lemma 9.2
If algorithm broadcast terminates, then ∀i: Vi = {s(k): 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1}.
Proof: When the first guard is false for each process, ∀i: Wi = Vi holds. When the second
guard is false for each process, all channels are empty, and from Lemma 9.1, Wi ⊆ Vk
where k is a neighbor of i. Therefore, Vi ⊆ Vk.
Now consider a directed cycle C that includes processes i and k. If for every pair of
processes across a channel (i, k) the condition Vi ⊆ Vk holds, then for ∀i, k ∈ C: Vi = Vk
must be true. Furthermore, in a strongly connected graph, every pair of processes (i, j) is
contained in a directed cycle; therefore, the condition Vi = Vj must hold for every pair of
processes (i, j) in the system. Also, since s(i) ∈ Vi, and no element is removed from a set,
finally, ∀i: Vi = {s(k): 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1}. ◾

172 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Theorem 9.1
Algorithm broadcast terminates in a bounded number of steps.
Proof: Let c0,c1,c2,…,cm−1 denote the m channels in the network. Consider the following
variant function that is a tuple of sets:
Y V V V Vn c c c cm = ( 0 , 1, 2 ,…, −1, 0 , 1, 2 ,…, −1 )
Initially, Y = (s(0), s(1), s(2),…, s(n−1), ∅, ∅, ∅,…,∅). After each execution of statement 1
by an eligible process, the content of some channel (in the second part of Y) grows in size.
After the execution of statement 2 by some eligible process k, the set Vk (in the first part
of Y) grows in size and all the input channels of process k become null. In either case,
whenever an eligible process executes an action, the value of the Y grows in the lexicographic
order. This growth is bounded since by Lemma 9.2, finally, Vi = {s(k): 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1}
holds. Therefore, the algorithm terminates in a bounded number of steps. ◾
The worst-case message complexity can be computed as follows: a process i sends something
out only when Vi changes. Starting from the initial value s(i), Vi can change at most
(n−1) times. Also, since each node can have at most (n−1) neighbors, each execution of
statement 1 sends at most (n−1) messages. Thus, a process can send at most (n−1)2 messages.
So the message complexity is O(n2) per process or O(n3) for the entire system.
9.3 TERMINATION-DETECTION ALGORITHMS
Consider a computation running on a network of processes whose topology is G = (V, E).
One possible mechanism of distributing the computation to the various processes is as follows:
The task is initially assigned to some node i ∈ V that will be called an initiator node.
The initiator delegates various parts of this task to its neighbors, which delegate parts of
their work to their neighbors, and so on. As the computation makes progress, these nodes
exchange messages among themselves. No one has knowledge about the entire topology of
the network, but every node knows about its local neighborhood.
A node, when viewed in isolation, can remain in one of the two states: active and passive.
A process is active when it has some enabled guards. A process that is not active is called
passive. If a process is in a passive state at a certain moment, then it does not necessarily
mean that the process will always remain passive—a message sent by an active neighbor
may wake up the process and make it active. An active process, on the other hand, eventually
switches to a passive state when it has executed all its local actions—these actions may
involve the sending of zero or more messages.
In this setting, an important question for the initiator is to decide whether the present
computation has terminated. Termination corresponds to the following three criteria:
(a) every process is in a passive state, (b) all channels are empty, and (c) the global state
of the system satisfies the desired postcondition. Note that the criteria for termination are
similar to those for deadlock, with the exception that in deadlock, the desired postcondition
Global State Collection ◾ 173
is not satisfied. Both termination and deadlock reflect quiescent conditions, and it is quiescence
detection that we are interested in. The proposed detection method does not guarantee
that the desired postcondition has been reached.
The network of processes participating in the computation forms a computation graph.
An example is shown in Figure 9.2. The computation graph is a directed graph: if node i
engages a neighboring node j by delegating a subtask, then we draw a directed edge from
i to j. Messages propagate along the direction of the edges. Let us use colors to distinguish
between active and passive processes: a process is white when it is passive, and black when it is
active. In Figure 9.2a, only 1 and 2 are active. In Figure 9.2b, 1 has turned passive, but 2 and 3
are active. In Figure 9.2c, 2 turned passive, 4 turned passive after being active for a period, but
5 became active, and 5 is trying to engage 2. The picture constantly changes. Per our assumption,
the computation is guaranteed to terminate, so eventually all nodes turn white, and all
channels become empty. It is this configuration that the initiator node 1 wants to detect.
To see why termination detection is important, remember that many computations in
distributed systems run in phases. Each phase of a computation runs over multiple processes
in the system, and to launch phase (i + 1), the initiator has to ascertain that phase i
has terminated for every process.
9.3.1 Dijkstra–Scholten Algorithm
In [DS80], Dijkstra and Scholten presented a signaling mechanism that enables the initiator
to determine whether the computation running on a network of processes has terminated.
The computation initiated by a single initiator and spreading over to several other
nodes in the network is called a diffusing computation, and its termination is reported to
the initiator as a single event. The signaling mechanism is superposed on the underlying
computation and is noninvasive in as much as it does not influence the underlying computation.
We follow the original treatment in [DS80].

and is trying to engage 2.
174 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
There are two kinds of messages in the network: signals propagate along the direction of the
edges, and acks propagate in the opposite direction. The initiator is a special node (called the
environment node) that has no edge directed toward it. Every other node is called an internal
node and is reachable from the environment node via the edges of the underlying network.
For each directed edge (i, j), call node j a successor of node i and node s a predecessor of
node j. The overall plan is as follows: The environment node initiates the computation by
sending signals that engage its successors—this also initiates the termination-detection
process.
An internal node that receives a signal may send out signals to engage its successors.
In this way, the computation spreads over a finite number of nodes in the network, and the
computation graph grows. Eventually, each node sends acks to a designated predecessor to
confirm the termination of the computation in the subgraph below it, and the computation
subgraph shrinks. When the environment node receives acks from each of its successors, it
detects the termination of the entire computation, and the computation subgraph becomes
empty. The crucial issue here is to decide when and to whom to send the acks.
For an edge (i, j), the difference between the number of signals sent by i and the number
of acks received from j will be called a deficit. A process keeps track of two different types
of deficits:
C = total deficit along its incoming edges
D = total deficit along its outgoing edges
By definition, these deficits are nonnegative integers—no node sends out an ack before
receiving a signal. This leads to the first invariant:
INV1. (C  0)(D  0)
Initially, for every node, C = 0 and D = 0. The environment node initiates the computation
by spontaneously sending a message to each of its k(k > 0) successors, so for that node,
C = 0 and D = k. For every other node in the system, the proposed signaling scheme [DS80]
preserves the following invariant:
INV2. (C > 0)(D = 0)
INV2 is the cornerstone of the proposed algorithm. An internal node sends out signals
only after it receives a signal from a predecessor node. This increases D for the sender, but
it does not affect INV2 as long as C > 0. The sending of an ack, however, reduces the sender’s
deficit C by 1—therefore, to preserve both INV1 and INV2, an ack is sent when the following
condition holds:
C C D INV1 INV2
C C D
( −  )( − >  = ) { }
= ( > )(   =
1 0 1 0 0
1 1 0
follows from and
)
= (C >1)(C =1D = 0) (9.1)
Global State Collection ◾ 175
This implies that an internal node returns an ack when its C exceeds 1 or when C = 1 and
D = 0, that is, it has received acks from each of its successors (and, of course, the local computation
at that node has terminated).
The proposed signaling scheme guarantees that the computation graph induced by
the edges with positive deficits is a rooted spanning tree with the environment node as the
root. The parent of an internal node is the first node from which it received a signal. The
root does not have a parent. When a leaf node of this tree becomes passive, it sends an ack
to its parent. This removes the node as well as the edge connecting it to its parent, and the
tree shrinks. Again when an active node sends a message to a passive successor, the passive
node becomes active, and the tree grows. By assumption, the underlying computation
terminates. So during the life of the underlying computation, the computation graph may
expand and contract a finite number of times and eventually becomes empty. This signals
the termination of the underlying algorithm.
Initially for each internal node i, parent(i) is set to i. Equation 9.1 leads to the following
program for each internal node:
program detect {for an internal node i}
define C, D : integer
m: (signal, ack) {represents the type of message received}
state: (active, passive)
initially C = 0, D = 0, parent(i) = i
do (m = signal) ∧ (C = 0) → C := 1; state := active;
parent := sender
{Read Note 1}
[] m = ack → D := D − 1
[] (C = 1 ∧ D = 0) ∧ (state = passive) → send ack to parent;
C:= 0; parent(i) = i
{Read Note 2}
[](m = signal) ∧ (C = 1) → send ack to the sender
od {Read Note 3}
Note 1: This node can send out messages to engage other nodes (which increases its D)
or may turn passive. It depends on the computation.
Note 2: This node now returns to the initial state and disappears from the computation
graph.
Note 3: This represents the action of sending an ack when C > 1 (see Equation 9.1).
By sending an ack to its parent, a node i provides the guarantee that all nodes that were
engaged by i or its descendants are passive and no message is in transit through any channel
leading to these descendants. The aforementioned condition will remain stable until node i
receives another signal. A leaf node does not have any successor, so it sends an ack as soon
as it turns passive. The environment node initiates the termination-detection algorithm by
making D = k (k > 0) and detects termination by the condition D = 0 after it receives k acks.
176 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The last statement of the program needs some clarification. A node with C = 1 can
receive a signal from a node, but it promptly sends an ack since the computation graph
induced by the edges with positive deficits must always be a tree. Thus, in Figure 9.2c,
if node 5 sends a signal to node 2, then node 2 becomes active but rejects the signal by
sending an ack to 5 as a refusal to accept 5 as its parent, and the deficit on the edge (5, 2)
remains 0. Thus, the computation graph remains a tree consisting of the nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and the edges (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).
Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm is an example of a class of algorithms called probe-echo
algorithm:
The signals are the probes, and the acks are the echoes. One can use the basic
messages from parents to their children as signals—the only control signals will be the acks.
As the computation spreads over various nodes, the edges with positive deficits form a spanning
tree that grows and shrinks. Due to the nondeterministic nature of the computation,
different runs of the algorithm may produce different spanning trees. The number of acks
will never exceed the number of messages exchanged by the underlying algorithm. This is
because, for each message between nodes, an ack is generated. If the underlying computation
fails to terminate (which violates our assumption), then the termination-detection algorithm
will also not terminate. Note that the algorithm is not designed to report nontermination.
Complexity issues: Since the basic messages of the underlying computation are used as
signals, and finally the deficits along all the edges must be zero, the number of control
messages (i.e., acks) must equal the number of basic messages of the underlying computation.
Chandrasekaran and Venkateshan [CV90] proved a lower bound that if the algorithm
starts by sending out signals after the actual termination of the underlying computation,
then it is possible to detect termination using only O(|E|) messages—each edge will carry
one signal and one ack. However, since the initiator does not correctly guess the time to
reach termination, the lower bound will not be actually attained. Moreover, to avoid false
detection, this scheme requires the edges to be FIFO.
The termination-detection algorithm can be easily modified to collect global states or
computing other kinds of global predicates. For example, consider the problem of counting
the number of processes in a network. If (1) the underlying computation is null, (2) the ack
from each process k to its parent is tagged with an integer variable size(k), the number of
processes in the subtree under it, and (3) each parent i, after receiving the acks from all of
its children, forwards the count

to its parent; then at the initiator node 0, 1 + size(0), will be the count of all the processes
in the system.
9.3.2 Termination Detection on a Unidirectional Ring
Another class of termination-detection algorithms uses token passing (instead of probes
and echoes) to detect termination. The main idea is as follows: Consider a distributed computation
running on a strongly connected directed graph. An initiator node sends out
Global State Collection ◾ 177
a token to traverse the network and observe the states of the processes. Each node, after
turning passive, forwards the token to the next process. When the token returns to the initiator,
it contains useful information about whether the computation has terminated. We
present here such an algorithm due to Dijkstra et al. [DFG83]. The algorithm is presented
for a unidirectional ring that is embedded on the topology of the given network—the order
of the processes in the ring is used to decide the order in which the token traverses the network.
Assume that in a system of n processes 0, 1, 2,…, n − 1, the embedded ring is specified
by 0→n−1→n−2→⋯2→1→0. The ring topology has no connection with the sending
and receiving of messages by the underlying algorithm—so a message can be sent by one
process to another as long as a path exists, even if they are not neighbors in the embedded
ring. All communication channels have zero delay, that is, message communication
is assumed to be instantaneous. This also implies that messages are received in the order
they are sent.
Without loss of generality, assume that process 0 is the initiator of termination detection
(Figure 9.3). The initiator initiates termination detection by sending out a token—it
traverses the network and eventually returns to the initiator. A process k accepting the
token will not forward it to its ring successor k − 1 mod n until it becomes passive. When
the initiator receives the token back, one may apparently believe that it detects termination.
However, this is too simplistic and is not foolproof. What if the token is currently with
process k, but a process j (n − 1 > j > k) that was passive now becomes active by receiving
a message from some process l (k > l > 0)? This could lead to a false detection, since the
activation of process j will go unnoticed!
To prevent such a false detection, refine the scheme by assigning the colors white and
black to processes and the token. Initially, all processes are white, and the initiator sends a
white token to process (n − 1). Define the following two rules:
Rule 1: When a noninitiator process sends a message to a higher numbered process, it
turns black.
Rule 2: When a black process sends a token, the token turns black. If a white process
forwards a token, then the token remains white.

releasing the token to its successor, received the message m from 2.
178 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
With these modifications, when the initiator receives a white token, termination is correctly
detected. The scenario described earlier will now return a black token to the initiator
(in Figure 9.3, process 2 turns black and transforms the white token into a black token),
making the decision inconclusive. A fresh round of token circulation will be necessary.
If indeed all processes turn passive during the next traversal of the token, then a white
token will return to process 0. However, a process like 2 needs to change its color to white
before the next traversal begins. This leads to the last rule:
Rule 3: After sending a token to its ring successor, a black process turns white.
The final program is as follows:
program term {for process i > 0}
define color, token: (black, white) {colors of process and token}
state : (active, passive)
do (token = white) ∧ (state ≠ passive) → skip
[] (token = white) ∧ (state = passive) →
if color(i) = black → color(i) := white; send a black token
[] color(i) = white → send a white token
fi
[] (token = black) →send a black token
[] i sends a message to a higher numbered process → color(i) :=
black
od
{for process 0}
send a white token;
do (token ≠ white) → send a white token od
{Termination is detected when process 0 receives a white token}
Theorem 9.2
Algorithm term is a correct termination-detection algorithm.
Proof: Assume that process 0 receives a white token. It means that
• Process 1 received a white token
• Process 1 is passive
• Process 1 did not send any message to process j, (1 < j < n − 1)
Since process 1 received a white token, it means that
• Process 2 received a white token
• Process 2 is passive
• Process 2 did not send any message to process j, (2 < j < n − 1)
Global State Collection ◾ 179
Continuing these arguments, one can easily conclude that process 0 receives a white token
when processes 1 . . n − 1 are all passive and none of them sent a message. This is a stable
condition since processes 1 . . n − 1 cannot receive a message anymore. This corresponds
to the termination of the computation. If some process i (i ≠ 0) activates process 0 in the
mean time, then process 0 will eventually turn passive and initiate a new round of token
circulation until it receives a white token. ◾
Note 1: Since the underlying algorithm is guaranteed to terminate, the terminationdetection
algorithm will also terminate.
Note 2: The assumption about instantaneous message communication is a strong one but
nevertheless necessary for correctness. To see why, assume that in Figure 9.3, the message
m takes a very long time to reach its destination. In the mean time, the black token reaches
the initiator, who initiates a fresh round of token circulation, while m is still in transit.
Eventually, process 0 receives a white token back and declares termination. But clearly, this
is false, since it will be negated when m will reach process (n − 2)!
Complexity issues: Let t be the number of messages in the underlying computation. Once
the initiator node starts the termination-detection algorithm by sending out a white token,
each of the m messages can potentially turn the white token into a black one. Therefore, the
maximum number of control messages is n . t.
9.3.3 Credit-Recovery Algorithm for Termination Detection
A slightly different approach to termination detection has been taken in Mattern’s creditrecovery
algorithm. In this algorithm, there is an initiator process that is the custodian
of a total credit share of 1 unit. The state of a process alternates between active and passive.
While sending messages, credit shares get distributed across processes in the network
according to some predefined rules. The activated processes eventually return their credit
shares to its initiator. By definition,
• For each active process i, credit(i) > 0.
• For each passive process i, credit(i) = 0.
Termination is detected when the initiator has recovered the entire credit sum from the
system of processes. The algorithm assumes that every process has a direct link with the
initiator, so that at an appropriate time, any process can return its credit share directly to
the initiator.
When one active process sends a message to another, it transfers a fraction of its credit
to the activated process through the activation message. Thus, each activation message
and each active process has a positive credit associated with it. When the initiator recovers
the entire credit, it clearly implies that there is neither any active process nor any
180 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
activation message in transit—this testifies the soundness of the approach. The rules for
credit distribution and credit recovery are as follows:
Rule 1: An active process with credit X, while sending a message to another process,
transfers a credit of Y = X/2 to it via the message. If the sender process sends the activation
message immediately before becoming passive, it may also transfer its whole
credit X with the activation message.
Rule 2: When a message with credit share Y arrives at a passive process, it becomes active
and the credit share Y is transferred to the activated process.
Rule 3: When an active process receives a message with credit share Y, it remains active
and Y is returned to the initiator. The algorithm assumes that each process has a
direct communication channel with the initiator.
Since the credit shares are transferred from one process to another by piggybacking on the
basic messages, the only control messages here are those that return the credit shares back
to the initiator. It is easy to observe that the number of control messages equals the number
of messages in the underlying computation. Thus, the message complexity is no better than
of the Dijkstra–Scholten termination-detection algorithm. However, by modifying Rule 3,
it is possible to reduce the message complexity. Consider the following modification:
Rule 3′: When an active process receives a message with credit share Y, it remains active
and the credit share Y is added to the share of the recipient.
With this modification, the only time credits are returned to the initiator is when a process
spontaneously turns passive from an active state. Accordingly, the message complexity of a
typical computation is much lower. Another issue is the problem of bookkeeping with the
fractional credits. While splitting a credit, it is not always possible to represent the fraction
by a variable of limited precision. Mattern suggests a way to tackle this is by specifying the
credit X as c = −log2 X. For further details, see [M89a].
9.4 WAVE ALGORITHMS
Various ideas for predicate detection or decision making based on state exploration have
been proposed since Dijkstra–Scholten termination-detection algorithms were published—
most of these are variations or generalizations of the basic ideas described in the
previous section. One such generalization is wave algorithms.
An initiator process spontaneously starts a wave algorithm by executing a local action that
triggers actions in the neighboring noninitiator nodes, which triggers further actions in their
neighbors. The resulting computation is called a wave, and it satisfies the following criteria:
• Each computation is finite.
• Each computation contains at least one decision event.
• A decision event is causally preceded by some event at each process.
Global State Collection ◾ 181
As an example, consider broadcasting a message M to every process in a unidirectional
ring. The initiator sends out the message to its neighbor, who forwards it to its neighbor,
and so on. When the initiator receives M, it stops forwarding M further, and the wave ends.
This is a decision event, following which the initiator may initiate another wave to accomplish
a different task. Here are a few examples of wave algorithms:
1. Barrier synchronization: Consider a distributed computation that runs in phases. An
initiator process starts phase 0, and all other processes execute phase 0 thereafter.
The constraint is as follows: no process starts phase i (i > 0) unless every process has
completed its phase (i − 1). Here, the decision event is the end of a phase.
2. Depth-first search (DFS): Consider searching an object in a network of processes. An
initiator initiates the search, and it ends with a decision event reporting to the initiator
if the object was found or not.
3. Propagation of information with feedback (PIF) [S83]: PIF is a method for broadcasting
a message to every node of a connected network and receiving a confirmation
that every process received the broadcast. Such a mechanism can be used to wake up
other nodes or start the execution of a new protocol at every node of a network. In the
following, we present an example of a PIF from Segall’s paper [S83].
9.4.1 Propagation of Information with Feedback
Consider a connected network G = (V, E), where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of bidirectional
edges. An initiator node i ∈ V wants to broadcast a message M to every node of the
network and receive a confirmation. The main idea is similar to that of Dijkstra–Scholten
algorithm in Section 9.3.1; however, the feedback mechanism is slightly different—a process
delays the sending of a copy of M (equivalent to an ack) to its parent until it receives
a copy of M over all links incident on it. A PIF algorithm for broadcasting a value M in a
network is presented as follows:
program PIF {for the initiator node i}
define count : integer
N(i): set of neighbors of process i
send M to each neighbor; count := |N(i)|
do count ≠ 0 ∧ M received → count: = count − 1 od
{program for a non-initiator node j≠i}
if message M received → parent := sender
send M to each neighbor except parent;
count := |N(j)|;
[] count > 0 ∧ M received → count: = count − 1
[] count = 0 → send M to parent
fi
For every node, the condition count = 0 signals the end of PIF and is a confirmation that
every node received M. Figure 9.4 illustrates the execution of the PIF algorithm on a network
of five nodes.
182 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
9.5 DISTRIBUTED DEADLOCK DETECTION
In a distributed system, a set of processes is deadlocked, when the computation reaches
some global state (different from the desired goal state) in which every process waits for
some other process to execute an action—a condition that can never be satisfied. Since all
well-behaved systems are expected to be free from deadlock, the motivation behind deadlock
detection needs some justification. In resource-sharing distributed systems involving
concurrent processes, there exist well-developed techniques for preventing the occurrence
of deadlock. However, the overhead of deadlock prevention mechanisms is sometimes prohibitive,
since it limits concurrency. Moreover, in real life, the occurrence of deadlock is
somewhat rare. So a cheaper alternative is to avoid deadlock prevention techniques and let
the computation take its own course with maximum possible concurrency—if deadlock
occurs, then detect it and resolve it by preempting resources or preempting processes, as
appropriate.
9.5.1 Resource Deadlock and Communication Deadlock
The detection of deadlock is simple when a single process acts as a central coordinator to
oversee the usage of all the resources of the system. This is because the coordinator has
a consistent picture of who is waiting for whom, which is represented using a wait for
graph (WFG). Deadlock detection is more difficult in systems without a central coordinator,
since fragments of the WFG are spread over various processes, and the computation of
a consistent WFG is a nontrivial problem.

Global State Collection ◾ 183
From an implementer’s perspective, it is useful to study how the WFG is formed and
maintained. Deadlock occurs when the following four conditions hold:
1. The access to each resource is mutually exclusive.
2. Requesting processes hold resources while requesting for more (hold and wait).
3. Resource scheduling is nonpreemptive.
4. Each process waits for another process to release a resource (circular waiting).
Consider a distributed database system where a set of processes executes a number of
transactions. Each transaction needs to acquire one or more locks to gain exclusive access
to certain types of objects—here, these locks are the resources. Let a process P execute
a transaction T1 for which it needs to acquire locks a, b, and c. Each process has a local
resource controller: assume that the local controller of P manages lock a, but locks b and
c are managed by the local controllers of processes Q and R, respectively. So after acquiring
lock a through its local controller, P sends requests for locks b and c to the controllers
of Q and R. This corresponds to the formation of two directed edges (P, Q) and (P, R) in
the WFG. If Q concurrently executes another transaction s2 that requires access to lock c,
then the WFG will contain another directed edge (Q, R). Now, if the resource controller of
R grants lock c to P, then Q will wait for P to release lock c. As a result, the edge (P, R) will
disappear, and a new edge (Q, P) will be formed.
Before we search for a new algorithm for deadlock detection, let us ask: Couldn’t
we use Dijkstra–Scholten termination-detection algorithm for this purpose? This
algorithm is certainly able to detect the condition when every process in the system is
waiting. However, deadlock is also possible when a subset of processes is involved in a
circular waiting condition. This is known as partial deadlock, and it cannot be readily
detected using Dijkstra–Scholten’s method. This motivates the search for other deadlock
detection algorithms.
The choice of a proper algorithm also depends on the model of deadlock. Deadlocks
arising out of the actions described in the transaction-processing scenario previously
are characteristics of the resource deadlock model. In the resource deadlock model, a
process waits until it has received all the resources that it has requested. The resource
model is also called the AND model. In this model, a deadlock occurs if and only if
there is a cycle of waiting processes, each dependent on the next process in the cycle to
make progress. There is, however, another kind of deadlock model that has been considered
in the present context—it is called the communication deadlock model. Consider
the message-
passing model of communication. The local states of the processes alternate
between active and passive. A process P that is passive now may become active
after receiving a message from any one of a set of processes—call it the dependent set
depend(P) of P. In the corresponding WFG, a directed edge is drawn from each process
in depend(P) to P. Since P can be activated by any of the processes in its dependent set,
the corresponding model is called the OR model. We don’t care about the activation

mechanism but assume that everything is controlled by messages. In a subset S of the
set of processes, a communication deadlock occurs when
1. Every process in S is passive
2. ∀i ∈ S, depend(i) ⊆ S
3. All communication channels between processes in S are empty
It is clear that since all incoming channels to the processes in S are empty, none of them can
ever be active and the condition is stable. The corresponding subgraph is called a knot. This
section discusses two distributed deadlock detection algorithms for these cases—these
algorithms due to Chandy et al. [CMH83].
9.5.2 Detection of Resource Deadlock
In a system of n processes 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1, define succ(i) to be the subset of processes that
process i is waiting for. In the WFG, represent this by drawing a directed edge from process
i to every process j ∈ succ(i). An initiator node initiates deadlock detection by sending
probes down the edges of the WFG—the receipt of a probe by the initiator of that probe
indicates that the process is deadlocked—this is the main idea. These types of algorithms
are also known as edge-chasing algorithms.
A probe P(i, s, r) is a message with three components: i is the initiator process, s is the
sender process, and r is the receiver process. The algorithm is initiated by a waiting process i,
which sends P(i, i, j) to every process j that it is waiting for. We use the following notation in
the description of the algorithm:
Let depend[j, i] be a Boolean that indicates that process i cannot progress unless process
j releases a resource. Thus, depend(j, i) ⇒ j ∈ succm(i) (m > 0) in the WFG. Also,
depend[k, j] ∧ depend[j, i] ⇒ depend[k, i]. The initiator process i is deadlocked when it
discovers that depend[i, i] is true.
Assuming that no process waits for an event that is internal to it, the program for a typical
process k can be represented as follows:
program resource deadlock {program for process k}
define P() : probe {has three fields initiator, sender,
receiver}
depend[k]: array [0..n−1] of boolean
initially ∀j: 0 ≤ j ≤ n−1, depend[k,j] = false
do P(i,s,k) received ∧ k is waiting ∧ (k ≠ i) ∧ ¬depend(k, i)→
∀j ∈ succ(k): send P(i,k,j) to j;
depend(k,i) := true
[] P(i,s,k) received ∧ k is waiting ∧ (k = i) →
process k is deadlocked
od
The aforementioned algorithm detects deadlock, only when the initiator process is contained
in a cycle of the WFG. Thus, in Figure 9.5, if process 3 is the initiator, then it will
Global State Collection ◾ 185
eventually detect that it is deadlocked. However, process 2 is also unable to make progress,
but using this algorithm, process 2 cannot detect it!* Another observation is this: The initiator
will never know explicitly that it is not deadlocked—the absence of deadlock will
only be signaled by the eventual availability of the resource that it requested. The proof of
correctness follows.
Theorem 9.4
Deadlock is detected if and only if the initiator node belongs to a cycle of the WFG.
Proof: By definition, depend[j, i] implies that there is a directed path from process i to process
j in the WFG. By the first action, every process forwards the probe to each of its successors
in the WFG. Therefore, in a bounded number of steps, the initiator process i receives
the probe and detects that it is deadlocked (second action). If the initiator does not belong
to the cycle, then it will never receive its own probe, so deadlock will not be detected.
The first action guarantees that every probe is forwarded to its successors exactly
once. Since the number of nodes is finite, the algorithm terminates in a bounded number
of steps. ◾
9.5.3 Detection of Communication Deadlock
The second algorithm proposed in [CMH83] detects the OR version of communication
deadlock. As explained earlier, the OR model implies that when a process waits for messages
from multiple processes belonging to its dependent set, it can go ahead when it
receives any one of them. Consider the WFG in Figure 9.6. Here, process 3 will be able to
move ahead when it receives a message from either 1 or 4 (in the AND model, both were
necessary). Unfortunately, in this case, it will receive neither of them. In fact, no process will
get the resource it needs. Notice the knot here: Each of the processes in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} has
a dependent set that belongs to S. This is an example of communication deadlock.
There are similarities between the termination-detection algorithm of Dijkstra and
Scholten and the communication deadlock detection algorithm due to Chandy et al.
A waiting process initiates the deadlock detection algorithm by first sending probes

to all the processes in its dependent set. A process receiving the probe ignores it, if it
is not waiting for any other process. However, if the recipient of a probe is waiting for
another process, then it takes one of the following two steps:
• If this probe is received for the first time, then it marks the sender of the probe as its
parent and forwards it to every process in its dependent set.
• If this is not the first probe, then it sends an ack to the sender.
When a waiting process receives acks from every process in its dependent set, it sends an
ack to its parent. If the initiator receives ack from every process in its dependent set, then
it declares itself deadlocked.
For any node, let D represent the deficit (i.e., number of probes − number of acks) along its
outgoing edges. Starting from the initial condition in which an initiator node i has sent out
probe P(i, i, j) to every node j in its dependent set succ(i), the program is described as follows:
program communication deadlock

Global State Collection ◾ 187
When the initiator sends out probes, the precondition (D > 0) holds for the initiator. Deadlock is
detected when (D = 0) holds for the initiator and the algorithm terminates. The proof of correctness
of the communication deadlock detection algorithm is similar to the proof of correctness
of the termination-detection algorithm and is not separately discussed here.
Unlike the resource deadlock detection algorithm, the communication deadlock detection
algorithm requires two different types of messages (probe and ack) but has wider
applications. For example, using this algorithm, process 2 in Figure 9.5 can successfully
detect that it cannot make progress, even if it is not part of a cycle in the WFG.
The message complexities of both the resource deadlock and the communication deadlock
detection algorithms are O(|E|), where E is the set of edges in the WFG.
9.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Most of these algorithms are superposed on an underlying basic computation that remains
unaffected by the execution of the algorithms. This noninterference is much more pleasant
than an alternative unrealistic approach in which the underlying computation is frozen,
the desired global information is computed, and then the computation is restarted.
In deadlock detection, the presence of a cycle or a knot in the WFG is a stable property,
since process abortion or resource preemption is ruled out. A frequently asked question is:
What about possible modification of the proposed algorithms, so that not only the presence
but also the absence of deadlocks is reported to the initiator? Remember that little is
gained by detecting the absence of deadlock as it is an unstable property—if the initiator
discovers that there is no deadlock, then there is no guarantee that the resource will be
available, since much will depend on the pattern of requests after the absence of deadlock
has been detected!
The edge-chasing algorithms for deadlock detection only record consistent global
states—probes/acks report the finding after a cycle or a knot has been formed. Incorrect
application of this rule or ad hoc detection techniques may lead to the detection of false
deadlocks that plagued many old algorithms designed before the concept of consistent
global states was properly understood.
9.7 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
The termination-detection algorithm presented in this chapter is described in [DS80]. The
modified version with optimal message complexity appears in [CV90]. The token-based
solution was proposed by Dijkstra et al. [DFG83]. Misra [Mi83] presented a marker-based
algorithm for termination detection in completely connected graphs and suggested necessary
extensions for arbitrary network topologies. Segall [Se83] introduced PIF algorithms.
Chang [C82] explored probe-echo algorithms and demonstrated their applications for several
graph problems. In [M87] and [M89a], Mattern described different variations of the
termination-detection algorithm and introduced the credit-recovery algorithm. Tel [T00]
formally defined the framework of wave algorithms. Both of the deadlock detection algorithms
were proposed in [CMH83]. Knapp [K87] wrote a comprehensive survey of deadlock
detection algorithms and its applications in distributed databases.

9.1 Consider a unidirectional ring of n processes 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1. Process 0 wants to
detect termination, so after the local computation at 0 has terminated, it sends a
token to process 1. Process 1 forwards that token to process 2 after process 1’s computation
has terminated, and the token is passed around the ring in this manner.
When process 0 gets back the token, it concludes that the computation over the
entire ring has terminated.

Graph Algorithms
10.1 INTRODUCTION
The topology of a distributed system is represented by a graph where the nodes represent
processes and the links represent communication channels. Distributed algorithms
for various graph theoretic problems have numerous applications in communication and
networking. Here are some motivating examples.
The first example deals with routing in a communication network. When a message is
sent from node i to a nonneighboring node j, the intermediate nodes route the message
based on the information stored in the local routing table. This is called hop-by-hop or
destination-based routing. An important problem is to compute these routing tables and
maintain them, so that messages reach their destinations in the fewest number of hops,
or with minimum delay. Finding the minimum hop route is equivalent to computing the
shortest path between a pair of nodes using locally available information.
The second example focuses on the amount of space required by a node to store the routing
table. Without any optimization, the space requirement is O(n) where n is the number
of nodes. But with the explosive growth of the Internet, n is increasing at a steep rate—
therefore, the space requirement of the routing table as well as the overhead of maintaining
the routing table are matters of concern. This leads to the following question: Can we
reduce the size of the routing table? Given the value of n, what is the smallest amount of
information that each individual node must store in their routing tables, so that every message
eventually reaches its final destination?
The third example visits the problem of broadcasting in a network whose topology is
represented by a connected graph. Uncontrolled transmission of messages leads to flooding,
which wastes communication bandwidth. One way to save bandwidth is to transmit
the messages along the edges of a spanning tree of the graph. How to compute the spanning
tree of a graph? How to maintain a spanning tree when the topology changes?
The fourth example addresses the classical problem of computing of maximum flow
between a pair of nodes in a connected network. Here the flow represents the movement
of a certain commodity, like a bunch of packets, from one node to another. Each edge of
the network has a certain capacity (read bandwidth) that defines the upper limit of the
190 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
flow through that edge. This problem, known as the maxflow problem, is of fundamental
importance in networking and operations research.
An important issue in distributed algorithms for graphs is that of static vs. dynamic
topology. The topology is called static when it does not change. A topology that is not
static is called dynamic—it is the result of spontaneous addition and deletion of nodes and
edges, which reflects real-life situations. Clearly, algorithms for dynamic topologies are
more robust than those for static topologies only. In this chapter, we will study distributed
algorithms for solving a few graph theoretic problems.
10.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS
Routing is a fundamental problem in networks. Each node maintains a routing table
that determines how to route a packet to its destination. The routing table is updated
when the topology changes. A route can have many attributes: These include the number
of hops or the end-to-end delay. For efficient routing, a simple goal is to route a
message using minimum number of hops. In a more refined model, a cost is associated
with each link, and routing via the path of least cost may be required. For multimedia
applications, routing delay is a major factor. Link congestion can influence the delay
(so delay determines the cost). The path of minimum delay may change even if the
topology remains unchanged. In this section, we will discuss a few algorithms related
to routing.
10.2.1 Computation of Shortest Path
Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph where V = {0, 1, 2, …, n − 1} represents a set of
processes
and E ⊆ V × V represents a set of edges representing communication links.
Define N(i) to be the set of neighbors of node i. Each edge (i, j) has a weight w(i, j) that
represents the cost of communication through that edge. A simple path between a source
and a destination
node is called a shortest path, when the sum of all the weights in the path
between them is the smallest of all such paths. The weight w(i, j) of an edge is application
dependent. For computing
the path with minimum number of hops, we assume w(i, j) = 1.
However, when w(i, j) denotes the delay in message propagation through link (which
depends on the degree of congestion), the shortest path computation can be regarded as
the fastest path computation. To keep things simple, assume that w(i, j) ≥ 0. Our goal is
to present an asynchronous message-passing algorithm using which each node i ∈ V can
compute the shortest path to a designated node 0 (called the source or the root node) from
itself. This is known as the single-source shortest path problem.
A well-known algorithm for computing single-source shortest path is the Bellman–Ford
algorithm that was used to compute routes in the Advanced Research Projects Agency
Network (ARPANET) during 1969–1979. In this algorithm, each process i maintains two
variables:
• D(i) is the best knowledge of node i about its shortest distance to node 0
• parent(i) is the neighbor that leads to node 0 via the shortest path
Graph Algorithms ◾ 191
Clearly D(0) = 0, and by definition, parent(0) = null. Initially parent(i) = i and ∀i > 0:
D(i) = ∞. As the computation progresses, D(i) approaches its correct value (i.e., the shortest
distance from node i to node 0). See Figure 10.1.
Denote a message from a sender by (distance, sender id). The initiator node 0 initiates
the algorithm by sending out (D(0) + w(0, j), 0) to each node j ∈ N(0). The program is
described as follows:
program Bellman-Ford shortest path
{program for process 0}
send (D(0)+ w(0,j),0) to each node in j ∈ N(0)
{program for process j > 0, after receiving a message from process i}
do D(i) + w(i,j) < D(j)→
D(j):= D(i) + w(i,j);
parent(j):= i;
send the new D(j) to each node in N(j)\{i}
od
The action by a nonroot process is known as a relaxation step. When the computation
terminates, for every process i ∈ V, D(i) is the shortest distance from node i to node 0, and
the path (i, parent(i), parent(parent(i)) … 0) defines the shortest path from node i to node 0.
The algorithm works for both directed and undirected graphs. For directed graphs, the
messages are sent along the outgoing edges and received via the incoming edges.
Lemma 10.1
When the algorithm terminates, let k = parent(i). If D(k) is the distance of the shortest path
from k to 0, then D(i) = D(k) + w(k, i) is the distance of the shortest path from i to 0 and
the shortest path includes k.
Proof: Suppose this is false. Then the shortest path from i to 0 is via some neighbor j of i,
where j ≠ k. If D(j) + w(j, i) < D(k) + w(k, i), then at some point, i must have received a message
from j, and since D(i) > D(j) + w(j, i), node i would have set D(i) to D(j) + w(j, i) and parent(i)
to j. Even if the message from k was received later, i would not have modified D(i) any further,
since D(i) < D(k) + w(k, i) will hold. This contradicts the statement of the lemma. ◾

FIGURE 10.1 Shortest path computation in a weighted graph: For each node i > 0, the directed
edge (represented by a broken line) points to its parent node.
192 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The shortest path from node i to node 0 must be acyclic. Since there are a finite number
of acyclic paths from node i to node 0, and in each step D(i) decreases, the algorithm terminates
after a bounded number of steps.
10.2.1.1 Complexity Analysis
Under a synchronous model of computation, every eligible process executes a step in each
round, and the messages reach their destinations before the next round begins. So, it takes
at most (n − 1) rounds for the algorithm to terminate. This is because, by Lemma 10.1, once
D(parent(i)) attains its correct value, it takes one more round for D(i) to become correct.
Since (1) D(0) is always correct, (2) the paths are acyclic, and (3) there are n nodes, it may take
at most (n − 1) rounds for every D to be correct and the algorithm to terminate. Since in every
round every edge carries a message, the message complexity is (n − 1) ⋅ |E|, i.e., O(|V| ⋅ |E|).
Under an asynchronous model of computation, the complexity of Bellman–Ford algorithm
is higher. To visualize the worst case, consider the graph in Figure 10.2. Let n be odd.
Assign the weights to the various edges as shown, where k = (n − 3)/2. The unlabeled edges
have a weight 0. Now assume that the first message to reach node (n − 1) from node 0 follows
the path 0, 1, 2, 3, …,(n − 2), (n − 1). This leads to

value. Therefore, the time complexity measured by the number of steps is exponential.
So far, we assumed that the edge weights are not negative. If this assumption is relaxed
and cycles of negative weight are allowed to exist in a graph, then paths of arbitrarily small
length can be created via repeated traversal of the cyclic path. Accordingly, the algorithm
falls apart. Acyclic paths containing one or more edges with negative weights do not lead
to this anomaly. Bellman–Ford algorithm has a mechanism to detect such cycles and
aborting
the computation.

10.2.1.2 Chandy–Misra Modification of the Shortest Path Algorithm
In [CM82], Chandy and Misra proposed a modification of this algorithm—the modified
version not only detects the presence of cycles of negative weight but also detects
the termination of the computation by leveraging Dijkstra–Scholten terminationdetection
algorithms discussed in Chapter 9. Corresponding to every message sent by
a node, an acknowledgment signal (denoted by ack) is received. When the root node
receives all acknowledgments, termination is detected, and the value of D at each node
represents the distance of the shortest path between 0 and that node. To instrument
this idea, define a variable deficit, representing the number of unacknowledged messages.
Initially, for each node, deficit = 0. Node 0, after initiating the computation and
sending a message to each of its neighbors, sets its own deficit to |N(0)|. The program
is as follows:
program Chandy-Misra shortest path
{program for process 0}
send (D(0)+ w(0,k),0) to each node in k ∈ N(0);
deficit:= |N(0)|;
do D(i)+ w(i,0)≥ D(0)→ send ack to sender i
[] deficit > 0 ∧ ack → deficit:= deficit – 1
od; {deficit = 0 signals termination}
{program for process j > 0 after receiving a message from process i}
{initially ∀j:D(j) = ∞, deficit = 0}
do D(i)+ w(i,j)< D(j)→
if (deficit > 0)∧(parent ≠ j)→ send ack to parent fi;
D(j) := D(i)+ w(i, j);
parent := i; {the sender becomes the new parent}
send the new D(j) to each node in N(j){i};
deficit := deficit +|N(j)|−1
[] D(i)+ w(i, j)≥ D(j)→ send ack to sender j
[] deficit > 0 ∧ ack → deficit := deficit − 1
[] (deficit = 0) ∧ (parent ≠ j)→ send ack to parent; parent = j
od
To verify the termination-detection property, note that for a noninitiator node j, the
predicate
(parent ≠ j) indicates that node j has one unacknowledged message from its
parent. When node j discovers another shorter path (to the initiator) through a different
predecessor, it switches its parent. As in the Dijkstra–Scholten termination-detection
algorithm,
a node sends an acknowledgment to its parent only when its deficit = 0. If the
initiator receives a message, then the condition D(i) + w(i, 0) ≥ D(0) must hold, and the
initiator returns an acknowledgment to the sender. When the initiator receives a message
for which the condition D(i) + w(i, 0) < D(0) holds, the existence of a cycle with negative
weight is detected. This case is not discussed here.
When the weight of each edge is 1, the shortest path computation leads to the formation
of the breadth first search (BFS) spanning tree with the initiator as the root. Every node
194 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
with shortest hop distance D from the root has a parent whose shortest distance from the
root is D − 1. The set of all nodes and the edges joining each node with its parent define the
BFS spanning tree.
10.2.2 Distance-Vector Routing
Distance-vector routing uses the basic idea of shortest path routing but handles topology
changes. The routing table of a node (i.e., a router) is an array of tuples (destination,
next hop, distance). To send a packet to a given destination, it is forwarded to the node in
the corresponding next hop field of the tuple. In a graph G = (V, E) with n = |V| nodes,
the distance vector D(i) of node i contains n elements D(i, 0) through D(i, n − 1), where
D(i, j) defines the shortest distance of node i from node j. The distance-vector elements are
initialized
as follows:

j Ni i

Each node j periodically advertises its distance vector to its immediate neighbors. Every
neighbor i of j, after receiving the advertisements from its neighbors, updates its distancevector
elements (Figure 10.3a) as follows:
k  i :D(i,k) =minj (w(i, j)+D(j,k))
When a node j or a link incident on j crashes, some neighbor k of it detects the event and
sets the corresponding distance D(j, k) to ∞. Similarly, when a new node j joins the network,
or an existing node j is repaired, the neighbor k detecting it sets the corresponding distance
to D(j, k) to 1. Following this, the updated distance vector is advertised; the nodes receiving

Graph Algorithms ◾ 195
the update appropriately modify their distance vectors and forward those values to their
neighbors. In this way, eventually all nodes recompute their routing tables.
Unfortunately, depending on when a failure is detected, and when the advertisement is
sent out, the routing table may not stabilize soon. Consider the network of Figure 10.3b.
Initially, D(1, 3) = 2 and D(2, 3) = 1. As the link (2, 3) fails, D(2, 3) is set to ∞. But node 1
may still advertise D(1, 3) = 2 to nodes 0 and 2. As a result, node 2 will update D(2, 3)
to 3 and advertise it to nodes 1 and 0. Node 1, after receiving the advertisement from
node 2, will subsequently update D(1, 3) to 4. In this way, the values of D(1, 3) and D(2, 3)
will slowly spiral upward until they become very large. This slow convergence is a major
hurdle,
and it is called the count to infinity problem. In the implementations of distance
vector, ∞ is represented by a sufficiently large integer. The larger this integer, the slower
the convergence.
A partial remedy to the slow convergence rate is provided by the split horizon method,
where a node i is prevented from advertising D(i, k) to a neighbor j if j is the first hop for
destination
k. For example, in Figure 10.3b, the split horizon method will prevent node 1
from advertising D(1, 3) = 2 to node 2. However, if node 1 detects a direct connection
to 3,
then node 2 is free to advertise D(1, 3) = 1 to node 1. Note that this only avoids delays
caused by cycles of two nodes (i.e., 1 learning from 2 and 2 learning from 1), and not
cycles involving more than two nodes. Split horizon is often used with poison reverse,
where nodes adjacent to bad links (poisoned routes) advertise it back to other nodes in the
network instructing that certain paths no longer exist and should be removed from their
routing tables. In Figure 10.3b, node 2 will announce that the route (2, 3) is poisoned (done
by assigning a sufficiently large value max to D(2, 3)). After learning about a poisoned
route, other nodes will remove all paths using this link from their tables. Normal operation
resumes when node 2 notifies about the restoration of this link. This speeds up the
convergence to some extent.
Distance-vector routing protocols mostly run on small networks (usually fewer than
100 nodes). Examples of distance-vector routing protocols used in practice include RIP
(Routing Information Protocol) and IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). RIP
uses a limit on the hop count to determine how many nodes (routers) messages must go
through to reach its destination. A node is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds
the limit. The scalability of these protocols is poor and the slow convergence following a
topology
change is an issue.
10.2.3 Link-State Routing
This is an alternative method of shortest path routing. In comparison with distance-vector
routing, link-state routing protocol converges much faster and has better scalability. There are
two phases in link-state routing. In phase 1, each node i periodically broadcasts a link-
state
packet (LSP) consisting of the weights of all edges (i, j) incident on it to every other node in
the network. This is known as reliable flooding. In phase 2, each node collects the LSPs from
other nodes, independently computes the topology of the network, and determines the shortest
route between any pair of nodes using a known shortest path algorithm.
196 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Reliable flooding must guarantee that eventually every node receives the LSPs from
every other node and stores them in the array local. In this phase, there are two challenges:
The first challenge is how to control the termination of flooding so that the LSPs do
not roam around the network forever, and the second challenge is how to cope with node
(i.e., router) failures and restarts.
The first challenge is handled by asking each node to forward every LSP to its neighbors
exactly once—duplicate copies are discarded. Once each node receives every LSP,
no packet is in circulation any more. An LSP L(id, state, seq) is a message with three
components: id is the identifier of the initiator process, state is the link state consisting
of the weights of all edges incident on the initiator, and seq is the sequence number of
the packet. These sequence numbers help detect duplicate copies of LSPs originating
from a given node. The sequence numbers start from 0 and increase monotonically, so
a new LSP with a larger sequence number reflects that it is more recent and replaces an
old packet with a smaller sequence number. Only the most recent LSP is forwarded to
the neighbors. When failures are not taken into consideration, the correctness follows
trivially. The total number of LSPs circulating in the network due to the change of the
neighborhood of a single node is |E|, since the packet traverses each edge exactly once.
The protocol is as follows:
program link state {for node i}
define L() : link state packet LSP
seq : integerz
local : array [0..n – 1] of LSP {local[k] is the LSP from node k}
{initially, seq = 0, local[k] := (k, undefined for ∀k ≠i, 0)}
do neighborhood change detected →
compute link state S;
send L(i, S, seq) to k ∈ N(i);
local[0] := (i, S, seq)
seq := seq + 1
[] L(j, S, seq) received →
if(j = i) → discard L(j, S, seq)
[](j≠i)∧(L.seq > local[j].seq)→
enter L(j, S, seq) into the local database;
forward L(j, S, seq) to k∈N(i)\{sender}
[](j≠i)∧(L.seq ≤ local[j].seq)→
discard L(j, S, seq)
fi
do
An interesting issue here is the issue of overflow of the sequence number field, which can
cause the value of seq to abruptly change from its largest value to 0 and create confusion
about whether the packet with seq = 0 is a new or an old packet. An apparent remedy is to
use a large sequence number space—for example, with a 32-bit seq, even if a router creates
a new LSP every 60 s, it will take more than 200 years for seq to overflow. This is more than
the expected life of most routers. A 64-bit seq will be even better.
Graph Algorithms ◾ 197
The second challenge, that is, the failure of a node (or the temporary unavailability of a
router), can make the algorithm more complicated. The failure is detected by a neighbor,
which marks the link to the faulty node as unavailable. Subsequently, the detecting nodes
appropriately update their local states before the next broadcast. When a node i crashes,
the LSPs stored in it are lost. Subsequently, when node i resumes operation, it has no clue
about the previous value of its seq, so it reinitializes its seq to 0. As a consequence, other
nodes will discard the newer packets from node i in favor of older packets transmitted by
i in the past. This will continue until the value of its seq exceeds the last value of seq in the
LSPs transmitted by i before the crash. To cope with such an anomalous behavior, each
LSP also contains a time-to-live (TTL) field, which is an estimate of the time after which a
packet should be considered stale and removed from the local databases.
Even with a large space for seq, sometimes a malfunction can push the value of seq to the
edge of overflow. Before a node consciously causes an overflow, it should wait long enough
for its past LSPs to age out. The actual version of the protocol uses several optimizations
over the basic version described here.
Compared to distance-vector routing, link-state routing has better convergence rate.
Link-state routing is used in Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).
10.2.4 Interval Routing
Consider a connected network of n nodes. The conventional routing table used to direct
a message from one node to another is an array of (n − 1) entries, one for each destination
node. Each entry is of the type (destination, port number):destination = v and port
number
= k imply that to send a packet to its destination v, the node should forward it to
port k. Since the size of the routing table grows linearly with the size of the network, scalability
suffers. Can we do something to reduce the growth of the routing tables even if n is
large? Interval routing is such a scheme.
Santoro and Khatib [SK85] first proposed interval routing for tree topologies only. To
motivate the discussion on interval routing, consider the network shown in Figure 10.4.
Each node has two ports: port 0 is connected to a node of higher id, and port 1 is connected
with a node of lower id.

FIGURE 10.4 An illustration of compact routing.
198 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
To take a routing decision, a process simply compares its own id with the id of the destination
node in the incoming packet. If the destination id is larger than its own id, then
the message is routed through port 0. If the destination id is smaller, then the message is
forwarded through port 1. If the two ids are equal, then the message is meant for local
delivery. Clearly, in this case, the number of entries in the routing table does not change
with the size of the network. This is an example of a compact routing table.
Interval routing uses a similar concept. Each node has one or more ports, and each port
is labeled with a nonnegative integer. In a network of n nodes numbered 0.. n − 1, define the
interval [p, q) between ports p and q as follows:
if p < q then[p,q) = p,p +1,p + 2,…,q −2,q −1
if p  q then[p,q) = p,p +1,p + 2,…,n −2,n −1,0,1,2,…,q −2,q −1
As an example, if n = 8, then [3, 7) = 3, 4, 5, 6, [5, 5) = 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and [6, 1) = 6, 7, 0.
Each node arranges the ports in the ascending order and computes the intervals between
successive port numbers. Clearly, these intervals are nonoverlapping. Routing uses the following
rule:
10.2.4.1 Interval Routing Rule
If the destination of a message belongs to the interval [p, q), then send the message to port p.
The key problem in interval routing is the assignment of appropriate labels to the various
nodes and their ports. Figure 10.5 shows a labeling scheme for a tree with n = 11 nodes
0, 1, 2, …, 9, 10 and illustrates how data will be forwarded.
In Figure 10.5, node 1 will send a message to node 5 through port 3, since the destination
5 is in the interval [3, 7). However, if node 1 wants to send the message to node 9,

then it has to route it through port 7, since the destination 9 belongs to the interval [7, 2).
Presented in the following is a labeling scheme for a rooted tree of n nodes:
1. Label the root as node 0, do a preorder traversal of the tree, and label the successive
nodes in ascending order starting from 1.

label the port towards the parent by L(i) + T(i) + 1 mod n, where
a. L(i) is the label of the node i
b. T(i) is the number of nodes in the subtree under node i (excluding i)
As a consequence of the preorder traversal, the first child of node i has a label L(i) + 1, and
the last child has a label L(i) + T(i) + mod n. Thus, the interval [L(i) + 1 mod n, L(i) + T(i) +
1 mod n) contains the labels of all the nodes in the subtree under i. The complementary
interval [L(i) + T(i) + 1 mod n, L(i) + 1 mod n) includes every destination node that does
not belong to the subtree under node i.
For nontree topologies, a simple extension involves constructing a spanning tree of the
graph and using interval routing on the spanning tree. However, this method does not
utilize the nontree edges to reduce the routing distances. Van Leeuwen and Tan [LT87]
proposed an improved labeling scheme for interval routing on nontree topologies—their
method uses some nontree edges for efficient routing. Figure 10.6a illustrates an example
of optimal labeling on a ring topology. Note that not all labeling leads to optimal routes
towards the destination. For trees, this is a nonissue, since there is exactly one path between
any pair of nodes.
Optimal paths can be more easily found in arbitrary networks if multiple labels are used
for the various ports. This leads to multiple intervals for each destination: thus, if two successive
ports p, q of a node bear the labels L(p) = p1, p2 and L(q) = q1, q2, then a packet can be

routed through port p when the destination id belongs to any one of the intervals [p1, q1) or
[p2, q2). Optimal routing may need up to Θ(n) labels per node, but a slight compromise with
optimality has the potential to drastically reduce the size of the routing table. A variant of the
interval-labeling scheme uses only a linear interval for each port with no wraparound. This
is called linear interval routing. In [BLT91], the authors show that although some well-known
networks like hypercubes and grids have feasible linear interval routing schemes, there exist
graphs in which no linear interval routing is possible. The example in Figure 10.4 demonstrates
linear interval routing by assigning the interval [i + 1, n − 1] to port 0 and [0, i − 1] to
port 1 of node i, but no linear interval routing exists for the network in Figure 10.6b.
10.2.5 Prefix Routing
While compactness of routing tables is the motivation behind interval routing, a major
obstacle is its poor ability of adaptation to changes in the topology. Every time a new node
or a link is added to a network, a very large fraction of the node and port labels have to be
recomputed. This is awkward.
An alternative technique for routing using compact routing tables is prefix routing,
which overcomes the poor adaptivity of classical interval routing to topology changes.
Figure 10.7 illustrates the concept of prefix routing. The label of a node or a port is a string
of characters from an alphabet σ = {a, b, c, d, …}. The additional symbol λ designates the
empty string, and ∀x ∈ σ, λ · x = x. To assign labels, first construct a spanning tree of the
given network, and designate a node as the root. Then, use the following rules:
1. Label the root by λ.
2. If a node has a label L, then label its child by L · x (x ∈ σ), that is, extend the label by an
element of σ. The added label must be unique for each child. (Thus, the labels of two
children of this node may be L · a and L · b.)

Graph Algorithms ◾ 201
3. Label every port from a parent to its child by the label of the child and every port
from a child to its parent by the empty string λ.
4. If (u, v) is a nontree edge, then label the port of node u by the label of node v. If,
however,
node v is the root, then label the port from u to its parent p by the label of
node p (instead of λ in Rule 4).
The first three rules are adequate for labeling a tree. Rule 4 is needed for dealing with nontree
topologies only.
Let us now examine the rules for routing a message to its destination. Let X be the label
of the destination node. When a node with label Y receives this message, it makes the routing
decision as follows:
program prefix routing
{Y = label of the current node, X = label of the destination}
if X = Y → deliver message locally
[] X ≠ Y → forward message to the port labeled with the longest
prefix of X
fi
When a new node is added to a tree, new labels are assigned to that node and the edge
connecting it, without modifying the labels of any of the existing nodes and ports. The size
of the labels equals the depth of the spanning tree, and the size of the routing table at each
node is O(Δ), where Δ is the degree of the node.
A variation of prefix routing is used in a class of structured overlay networks, commonly
known as peer-to-peer networks. These are very large networks used for content sharing,
so scalability is an important issue. The form of compact routing used in such networks
guarantees that both the size of the routing table and the number of hops needed to reach
one node from another are O(log n). We will address this in Chapter 21.
10.3 GRAPH TRAVERSAL
Given an undirected connected graph G = (V, E), a traversal is the process of visiting all
the nodes of the graph before returning to the initiator. A single initiator initiates each
traversal. The visitor is a message (or a token or a query) that moves from one node to its
neighbor in each hop. At any stage, there is a single message in transit. Since no node has
global knowledge about the topology of G, the routing decision at each node is completely
local. Traversal algorithms have numerous applications, starting from simple multicast
and global state collection to web crawling, network routing, and solving game strategy–
related problems.
Traversals on specific topologies like ring, tree, or clique are well covered in many
textbooks.
We will focus only on traversal of general graphs. The intellectually challenging
task is the correctness of the traversal algorithm that will certify that all nodes will be
visited and the visitor will eventually return to the initiator.
202 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
One approach is to construct a spanning tree of the graph and use a tree traversal
algorithm.
For a tree, the two important traversal orders are DFS and BFS. The shortest
path algorithms generate a BFS tree when the edge weights are equal. In the following, we
present a couple of algorithms for the construction of spanning trees.
10.3.1 Spanning Tree Construction
Let G = (V, E) represent an undirected graph where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of
edges. A spanning tree of G is a maximal connected subgraph T = (V, E′), E′ ⊆ E such that
if one more edge from the set (E\E′) is added to T, then the subgraph ceases to be a tree.
To construct a rooted spanning tree, a specific node is designated as the root. Several algorithms
described in this chapter and in the previous chapter generate a spanning tree. For
example, Dijkstra–Scholten termination-detection algorithm (Chapter 9) generates a spanning
tree while detecting the termination of a diffusing computation. The Bellman–Ford shortest
path algorithm also generates a BFS spanning tree when the weight of each edge is 1. In this
section, we present another asynchronous message-passing algorithm for constructing a rooted
spanning tree proposed by Chang [C82]. In this algorithm, the root node initiates the construction
by sending out empty messages as probes to its neighbors. A process receiving a probe for
the first time forwards it to all the neighbors except the one from which it received the probe;
otherwise, it sends the probe back to the sender. Thereafter, each process counts the number of
probes that they receive. When the number of probes received by the initiator node equals the
number of its neighbors, the algorithm terminates. The steps are presented in the following:
program Changs’s spanning tree
define probe, echo: messages, parent: process
initially ∀i>0, parent(i)=i, parent(0)=undefined
{program of the initiator node 0}
1 send probe to each neighbor j ∈ N(0)
2 do number of echoes ≠ number of probes →
3 echo received → echo:= echo + 1
4 probe received → send echo to the sender
5 od
6 {program for node j>0 , after receiving a probe}
7 first probe → parent:= sender; forward probe to non-parent
neighbors;
8 do number of echoes ≠ number of probes →
9 echo received → echo:=echo+1
10 probe received → send echo to the sender
11 od
12 send echo to parent; parent(i):= i
The set of nodes and the edges connecting each node with its parent define the spanning
tree. In the following, we argue about the termination of Chang’s algorithm:
Define deficit = (number of probes − number of echoes) in the entire system. Let P denote
the number of processes that have not received the probe m so far. We use F = (P, deficit)
Graph Algorithms ◾ 203
as the variant function. Initially, P = n − 1 and deficit
= 0. Observe that after every action,
the value of F decreases lexicographically. Actions 3, 4, 9, 10, 12 decrease the value of deficit
and thus reduce F. Actions 1, 7 increase the number of probes (and therefore the value
of deficit) but, at the same time, reduce the value of P, so F decreases lexicographically.
The smallest possible value of F is (0,0), which represents
the terminal configuration.
Therefore, the system reaches the terminal
configuration in a bounded number of steps.
Figure 10.8 shows the result of such a construction with 0 as the root. The structure of
spanning tree depends on the message propagation delays. Since these delays are arbitrary,
different runs of the algorithm lead to different spanning trees.
The message complexity is 2 ⋅ |E| since through each edge, a probe and an echo travel
exactly once. If the root of the spanning tree is not designated, then to use the previous
algorithm, a root has to be identified first. This requires a leader election phase. Leader
election will be addressed in a subsequent chapter.
10.3.2 Tarry’s Graph Traversal Algorithm
In 1895, Tarry proposed an algorithm [Ta1895] for graph traversal. It is the oldest known
traversal algorithm and hence an interesting candidate for study. An initiator sends out a
token to discover the traversal route. Define the parent of a node as one from which the
token is received for the first time. All other neighboring nodes will be called neighbors.
By
definition, the initiator does not have a parent. The following two rules define the algorithm:
Rule 1: Send the token toward each neighbor exactly once.
Rule 2: If rule 1 cannot be used to send the token, then send the token to its parent.
When the token returns to the root, the entire graph has been traversed.
In the graph of Figure 10.9, a possible traversal route for the token is 0 1 2 5 3 1 4 6 2 6 4 1
3 5 2 1 0. Each edge is traversed twice, once in each direction, and the edges connecting
each
node with its parent form a spanning tree. Note that in different runs, Tarry’s algorithm
may generate different spanning trees, some of which are not DFS.
To prove that Tarry’s algorithm is a traversal algorithm, we need to show that (1) at least
one of the rules is applicable until the token returns to the root and (2) eventually every
node is visited.

Lemma 10.2
The token has a valid move until it returns to the root.
Proof: Initially when the token is at the root, rule 1 is applicable. Assume that the token
reached a node i ≠ root from node j = parent(i). It must have reached there. If rule 1 does
not apply, then rule 2 must be applicable since the path from i to its parent node j remains
to be traversed. It is not feasible for the token to stay at i if that path is already traversed.
Thus, the token has a valid move. ◾
Lemma 10.3
Eventually, every node is visited by the token.
Proof (by contradiction): Consider a node j that has been visited, but a neighbor k ∈ N(j)
has not been visited and the token has returned to the root. Since the token finally leaves j
via the edge toward its parent (rule 2), j must have forwarded the token to every neighbor
(rule 1) prior to this. This includes k, and it leads to a contradiction. ◾
Since the token traverses each edge exactly twice (once in each direction), the message
complexity of Tarry’s algorithm is 2 ⋅ |E|.
10.3.3 Minimum Spanning Tree Construction
A given graph G = (V, E), in general, can have many different spanning trees. To each edge of G,
assign a weight to denote the cost of using that edge in an application. The weight of a spanning
tree is the sum of the weights of all its edges. Of all the possible spanning trees of a graph, the
spanning tree with the smallest weight is called the minimum spanning
tree (MST). The MST
has many applications. Consider building a subway system connecting a number of places of
interest in a metro. There is a cost of digging underground tunnels and laying train lines, and
this cost depends on the pair of endpoints chosen. An MST connecting the places of interest
will keep the project cost to a minimum. In a communication
network, if there is a predefined

cost for sending a packet across the different edges, then the MST helps broadcast data packets
to all nodes at minimum cost. Two well-known sequential algorithms for computing the MST
are Prim’s algorithm (also called Prim–Dijkstra algorithm) and Kruskal’s algorithm.
Prim’s algorithm of building the MST is a greedy algorithm and starts with a tree T = (V′, E′)
where V′ = {i} (the construction can start from any node i ∈ V) and E′ = Ø. The MST construction
augments T by adding an edge (k, j) ∈ E such that (1) k ∈ V′ and (2) j ∉ V′, and (k, j) has
the smallest weight of all such edges. This augmentation clearly guarantees that no cycle is
created. Recursive application of this step leads to the final MST, when V′ = V. In case a choice
has to be made between two or more edges with the same cost, any one of them can be chosen.
Kruskal’s algorithm is also a greedy algorithm but works somewhat differently: It starts with a
forest G′ = (V, E′), where E′ = Ø, and augments G′ by adding the edge (k, j) ∈ E such that (1) (k, j)
has the smallest weight of all the edges not belonging to E′ and (2) no cycle is created. When
(|V| − 1) edges have been added, the MST is formed. As in Prim’s algorithm, when a choice has
to be made between two or more edges with the same weight, anyone of them can be chosen.
Before we present a distributed algorithm for MST, consider the following lemma.
Lemma 10.4
If the weight of every edge is distinct, then the MST is unique.
Proof (by contradiction): Suppose the MST is not unique. Then, there must be at least two
MSTs: MST1 and MST2 of the given graph. Let e1 be the edge of the smallest weight that
belongs to MST1 but not MST2. Add e1 to MST2—this will form a cycle. Now, break the
cycle by deleting an edge e2 that does not belong to MST1 (clearly, e2 must exist). This process
yields a tree whose total weight is lower than that of MST1. So MST1 cannot be an MST. ◾
In [GHS83], Gallager et al. proposed a distributed algorithm for constructing
the MST of a
connected graph in which the edge weights are unique. Their algorithm works on a messagepassing
model and can be viewed as a distributed implementation of Prim’s algorithm.
It uses a
bottom-up approach (Figure 10.10). The main strategy is summarized later.

FIGURE 10.10 An example showing two fragments T1 and T2 being joined by a minimum cost
edge e into a larger fragment.
206 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
10.3.3.1 Overall Strategy
Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. Consider two MSTs T1 = (V1, E1) and T2 = (V2, E2)
(called fragments in GHS83) involving the subsets of nodes V1 and V2, respectively, such
that V1 ∩ V2 = Ø. Let e be an edge with the minimum weight connecting a node in T1 with
a node in T2. Then, the subgraph consisting of T1, T2, e is the MST covering the nodes
V1 ∪ V2.
Initially, each single node is a fragment. The repeated application of the previous strategy
forms the MST of G. However, a distributed implementation of the merging algorithm
involves the following challenges:
Challenge 1: How will the nodes in a given fragment identify the edge (of least weight) to be
used for connecting with a different fragment?
The answer is that each fragment will designate a coordinator (also called the root) to initiate
the search, and this coordinator will coordinate the task of choosing the least weight
outgoing edge connecting to a different fragment.
Challenge 2: How will a node in fragment T1 determine if a given edge connects to a node
of a different tree T2 or the same tree T1? In Figure 10.10, why will node 0 choose the edge
e with weight 8, and not the edge with weight 4?
A solution is that all nodes in the same fragment must acquire the same name before
the augmentation takes place. The augmenting edge must connect to a node belonging to
a fragment with a different name.
In [GHS83], each fragment belongs to a level, which is a nonnegative integer. Initially,
each individual node is a fragment at level 0. Fragments join with one another in the
following
two ways:
(Merge) A fragment at level L connects to another fragment at the same level. The level of
the resulting fragment becomes (L + 1), and the resulting fragment is named after the
edge joining the two fragments (which is unique since the edge weights are unique).
In Figure 10.10, the combined fragment will be named 8, which is the weight of the
edge e.
(Absorb) A fragment at level L joins with a fragment at level L′ > L. In this case, the level
of the combined fragment becomes L′. The fragment at level L acquires the name of
the fragment at level L′.
As a consequence of the aforementioned two operations, each fragment at level L has
at least 2L nodes in it. The grand plan is to generate the MST in at most log2n levels, where
n = |V|. One can argue that instead of a larger fragment absorbing the smaller one, the
smaller fragment could absorb the larger one. However, the number of messages needed
for one fragment T1 to be absorbed by another fragment T2 depends on the size of the
T1—so the proposed rule will lead to a lower message complexity.
Each fragment maintains a rooted spanning tree. Communication inside a fragment
takes place via the edges of the spanning tree. Initially, every singleton node is a fragment,
Graph Algorithms ◾ 207
and this node serves as the root of its own fragment. Each node then looks for the least
weight edge connecting to a neighbor. If both nodes pick each other, then a fragment of two
nodes is formed at level 1. In this fragment, the node with higher id serves as the new root.
In general, whenever two fragments merge, the node with higher id across the least weight
outgoing edge serves as the new root. During an absorb operation, however, the root of the
fragment with a larger level number continues to serve as the new root. This new root acts
as the coordinator of that fragment for the next stage of expansion. The notification about
the change of root within a fragment is sent out using the changeroot message. To facilitate
communication within a fragment, every node keeps track of its parent and children—for
multicast, the root uses the chain of child pointers, and for convergecast, nodes reach the
root following the chain of parent pointers.
10.3.3.2 Detecting the Least Weight Outgoing Edge
When the root sends an initiate message, the nodes of that fragment search for the least
weight outgoing edge (lwoe). Each node reports the finding through a report message to its
parent. When the root receives the report from every process in its fragment, it determines
the least weight outgoing edge for that fragment. The total number of messages required to
detect the lwoe is O(|Vi|), where Vi is the set of nodes in the given fragment.
To test if a given edge is outgoing, a node sends a test message through that edge. The
node at the other end may respond with a reject message (when it belongs to the same fragment
as the sender) or an accept message (when it is certain that it belongs to a different
fragment). While rejection is straightforward, acceptance in some cases may be tricky. For
example, it may be the case that the responding node belongs to a different fragment name
when it receives the test message, but its fragment is in the process of merging with the
fragment of the sending node. To deal with this dilemma, when node i sends a test message
(containing its name and level) to node j, the responses from node j (containing its name
and level) are as follows:
Case 1: if name(i) = name(j), then send reject.
Case 2: if (name(i) ≠ name(j)) ∧ (level(i) ≤ level(j)), then send accept.
Case 3: if (name(i) ≠ name(j)) ∧ (level(i) > level(j)), then delay sending a response until
level(j) ≥ level(i) or name(i) = name(j).
Note that the level numbers never decrease, and by allowing a node to send an accept
message only when its level is at least as large as that of the sending node (and the fragment
names are different), the dilemma is resolved.
To guarantee the absence of deadlock, we need to establish that the waiting period in
case 3 is finite. Suppose this is not true. Then, there must exist a finite chain of fragments
T0, T1, T2, …, Tk−1 of progressively decreasing levels, such that Ti (0 ≤ i ≤ k – 1) has sent
a test message to Ti+1. But then the last fragment in the chain must also have sent a test
message to another fragment of the same or higher level, and it is guaranteed to receive
a response, enabling it to combine with another fragment and raise its level. Thus, the
wait is only finite.
208 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
For the sake of bookkeeping, each edge is classified into one of the three categories:
basic, branch, and rejected. Initially, every edge is a basic edge. When a reject message is
sent through an edge, it is classified as rejected. Finally, when a basic edge becomes a tree
edge, its status changes to branch. The following lemma is trivially true:
Lemma 10.5
The attributes branch and rejected are stable.
As a consequence of Lemma 10.5, while searching for the least weight output edge, test
messages are sent through the basic edges only.
Once the lwoe has been found, the root node sends out a changeroot message to the
nodes in its own fragment. This is the approval from the leader to go ahead. The node at
the end of lwoe receiving the changeroot message sends out a join message to the node
at the other end of the lwoe, indicating its willingness to join. The join message initiates a
merge or an absorb operation. Some possible scenarios are summarized as follows:
Scenario 1: Merge: A node i in a fragment T at level L sends out a (join, level = L, name = T)
message to a node j in another fragment T′ at the same level L′ = L and receives a (join,
level = L′, name = T′) message in return (Figure 10.11). Thereafter, the edge through which
the join messages were exchanged becomes a tree edge and changes its status to branch.
Between the two nodes (i, j) at the endpoints of the lwoe, the one with the larger id serves as
the new root. The new name of the fragment corresponds to the weight of the edge (i, j) and
its level changes to (L + 1). The new root starts the next phase by broadcasting an (initiate,
L + 1, name) message to the nodes in the combined fragment.

Scenario 2: Absorb: A node i in a fragment T at level L sends out a (join, level = L, name = T)
message to a node j in another fragment T′ at level L′ > L across its lwoe. If the fragment
T′ has not completed its search for lwoe, then it absorbs T and includes it in the search by
sending a (join, level = L′, name = T′) message in return. The root of the fragment at level
L′ continues to serve as the root of the combined fragment. Fragment T at level L changes
its level to L′ and acquires the name T′ of the other fragment. Then, they collectively search
for the lwoe. The edge through which the join message is received becomes a tree edge and
changes its status to branch.
If the fragment L′ has already chosen its lwoe, then that must be distinct from the edge
(i, j); otherwise, T would have already known about it. In this case, T′ may be waiting
to join with another fragment T″. Once T′ joins with another fragment, it will initiate
the next search of lwoe and will send an initiate message to the nodes in T to signal the
absorption. The algorithm terminates and the MST is formed when no new outgoing
edge is found in a fragment. A complete example of MST formation is illustrated in
Figure 10.12.
What if every fragment sends a join message to a different fragment, but no fragment
receives a reciprocating join message to complete the handshake? Can such a situation
arise, affecting the progress property? The next lemma shows that this is impossible.

but 5 does not respond until it has formed a fragment by joining with node 2 (part b). Part (c) shows

210 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Lemma 10.6
Until the MST is formed, there must always be a pair of fragments, such that the roots of
these two fragments will send a join message to each other.
Proof: Consider the fragments across the edge of least weight. They must send join messages
to each other. This will trigger either a merge or an absorb operation. ◾
10.3.3.3 Message Complexity
Since a fragment at level k has at least 2k nodes, the maximum level number cannot exceed
log2 n. In each of these levels, each node receives (1) at most one initiate message from
the root and (2) at most one accept message (response to a test message) and sends (3) one
report message (response to initiate) toward the root, (4) at most one test message leading
to an accept from the other end, and (5) one changeroot message (or a join message to a
different fragment). Since there are n nodes, an upper bound of these messages is 5n ⋅ log2n.
In addition to the above, count the test messages leading to a rejection. An edge is
rejected only once in the entire algorithm. So the number of these test and reject messages
will not exceed 2|E|. Therefore, the overall message complexity of the MST algorithm will
not exceed 5n ⋅ log2n + 2|E|.
10.4 GRAPH COLORING
Graph coloring is a classic problem in graph theory and has been extensively investigated.
The problem of node coloring in graphs can be stated as follows: Given a graph G = (V, E),
assign color to the nodes in V from a given set of colors, so that no two neighboring nodes
have the same color. If we assume that each process has a unique id, and use it as node color,
then it leads to a valid coloring. However, this is a trivial solution and not interesting at all.
The design of coloring algorithms becomes particularly challenging when the color palette
is small, and its size approaches the lower bound for a given class of graphs. The chromatic
number of a graph is the size of the smallest set of colors that can be used to color the graph. In
a distributed environment, knowledge is local—so no node knows anything about G beyond
its immediate neighbors. This adds to the difficulty of designing graph-coloring algorithms
in a distributed setting. To realize the difficulty, consider the graph in Figure 10.13.
Assume that nodes are anonymous and the process ids are being used for the purpose
of identification only. It is easy to observe that the nodes of this graph can be colored using
only two colors {0, 1}. Let c(i) denote the color of node i and N(i) denote the set of neighbors
0

of node i. Assume that initially, ∀i, c(i) = 0. On the shared memory model of computation,
let us try a naive algorithm:
program naive coloring
define c(i): color {of process i}
{program for process i}
do ∃j ∈ N(i):c(i)=c(j) → c(i):= 1 − c(i) od
Assume a central scheduler (so only one process executes a step at any time), and let each
node examine only one neighbor at a time (i.e., fine-grain atomicity). Unfortunately, the
naive algorithm does not terminate, since there exist infinite behaviors involving one or
more nodes.* If instead we modify the algorithm by allowing a node to examine its entire
neighborhood (i.e., coarse-grain atomicity) before choosing a new color that is distinct
from the colors of its neighbors, then after node 0 executes an action, node 2 does not have
any eligible action—so the computation hits a dead end.
10.4.1 (D + 1)-Coloring Algorithm
We now present a distributed algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph with (D + 1)
colors, where D is the maximum degree of a node. We will designate the set of all colors
by C. To make the problem a little more challenging, assume that the initial colors of the
nodes are arbitrary.
The algorithm runs on a shared memory model under a central scheduler. No fairness
is assumed. The atomicity is coarse-grained, so that a process can read the states of all its
neighbors and execute an action in a single step. Define nc(i) = {c(j): j ∈ N(i)}. Then, the
coloring algorithm is as follows:
program (D + 1) coloring
define c(i): color {of process i}, b: color
{program for process i}
do ∃j ∈ N(i):c(i)= c(j) → c(i):= b:b ∈ {C\nc(i)} od
Theorem 10.1
Program (D + 1) coloring produces a correct coloring of the nodes.
Proof: Each action by a node correctly sets its color with respect to those of its neighbors.
Once a node correctly sets its color, its guard is never enabled by the action of a neighboring
node. So regardless of the initial colors of the nodes, each node executes its action
at most once, and the algorithm requires at most (n − 1) steps to terminate. ◾
The size of the color palette used in the (D + 1)-coloring algorithm may be far from
optimal.
For example, consider a star graph where (n − 1) nodes are connected to a single
node that acts as the hub and n = 100. The (D + 1)-coloring algorithm will use 100 distinct
* Verify this before you proceed.
212 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
colors, whereas the graph can be colored using two colors only! Converting the graph into
a dag (directed acyclic graph) helps reduce the size of the color palette. In the transformed
dag, let succ(i) = {j: (i, j) ∈ E} denote the successors of node i. Also, let sc(i) = {c(j): j ∈ succ(i)}
and the size of the color palette C exceed |maxi (succ(i))|. Then, the following is an adaptation
of the (D + 1)-coloring algorithm for a dag:
program dag coloring;
{program for node i}
initially ∀i : c(i)=0;
do ∃j ∈ succ(i):c(i)= c(j)→ c(i):= b:b ∈ {C\sc(i)} od
For the star graph, if all the edges are directed towards the hub, then each node at the
periphery has only the hub as its successor, and the aforementioned algorithm can trivially
produce coloring with two colors only.
Theorem 10.2
The dag-coloring algorithm produces a correct coloring.
Proof (by induction): Any dag has at least one node with no outgoing edges—call such a
node a leaf. According to the program, the leaf nodes do not execute actions since they have
no successors. So their colors are stable. This is the base case.
After every node j ∈ succ(i) attains a stable color, it requires at most one more step for c(i)
to become stable, and such a color can always be found since the set {C\sc(i)} is nonempty.
Thus, the nodes at distance one from a leaf node acquire a stable color in at most one step,
those at distance 2 attain a stable color in at most (1 + 2) steps, and so on. Eventually, all
nodes are colored in at most 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ + L = L(L + 1)/2 steps where L is the length of the
longest directed path in the dag. ◾
Since L ≤ n – 1, the dag-generation algorithm will terminate in O(n2) steps. To use this
method for coloring undirected graphs, we need to devise a method for converting an
undirected graph into a dag. A straightforward approach is to construct a BFS spanning
tree and direct each edge toward a node of higher level, but the outdegree of some nodes
(and consequently the size of the color palette) may still be large. In some cases, we can do
much better. The next section addresses this issue with an example.
10.4.2 6-Coloring of Planar Graphs
In this section, we demonstrate a distributed algorithm for coloring the nodes of a planar graph
with at most six colors (the color palette C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). The basic principle is to transform
any given planar graph into a directed acyclic graph for which the degree of every node is <6
and execute the coloring algorithm on this dag. We begin with the assumption of coarse-grain
atomicity—in a single step, each node examines the states of all its neighbors and, if necessary,
executes an action. A central scheduler arbitrarily serializes the actions of the nodes.
Graph Algorithms ◾ 213
For any planar graph G = {V, E}, if e = |E| and n = |V|, then the following results can be
found in most books on graph theory (e.g., see [Ha72]).
Theorem 10.3
(Euler’s polyhedron formula) If n ≥ 3, then e ≤ 3n − 6.
Corollary 10.1
For any planar graph, there is at least one node with degree ≤ 5.
Call a node with degree ≤ 5 a core node. A distributed algorithm that assigns edge directions
works as follows. Initially, all edges are undirected:
program undirected to dag;
initially all edges are undirected;
{program for each node i}
do number of undirected edges incident on node i ≤ 5 →
make all undirected edges outgoing
od
At the beginning, at least one core node of G will mark all undirected edges incident on
them as outgoing. The remainder graph obtained by deleting the core nodes and the directed
edges from G is also a planar graph, so the core nodes of the remainder graph now mark the
undirected edges incident on them as outgoing. This continues until the remainder graph is
empty and all edges are directed. Clearly, this will not take more than n – 1 = |V| –1 steps.
Figure 10.14 shows two steps of the dag-generation process.
The coloring algorithm will work on this dag. Since ∀i ∈ V: sc(i) ≤ 5, the coloring algorithm
will generate a valid node coloring using at most (5 + 1) = 6 colors. Interestingly, the coloring

part of the algorithm need not wait for the dag-generation part of the algorithm to terminate—
both of them can run concurrently. The composite algorithm will be as follows:
program planar graph coloring;
{program for node i}
do {Layer A: dag generation actions}
number of undirected edges incident on it ≤ 5 →
make all undirected edges outgoing
{Layer B: coloring actions}
[](outdgree(i)≤ 5)∧(∃j ∈ succ(i):c(i)=c(j))→ c(i):= b:b ∈ {C\sc(i)}
od
Theorem 10.4
The 6-coloring algorithm for planar graph terminates in O(n2) steps.
Proof: After at most n = |V| steps of the dag-generation layer A, all edges will be directed.
The actions of the coloring layer B cannot undo the effect of dag-generation layer A, or disable
the actions of component A. Therefore, with a weakly fair scheduler, regardless of the
progress of component B, in a bounded number of steps of the composite algorithm, all
guards of component A will be disabled. Thereafter, in at most O(n2) steps, all nodes will
be properly colored. Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n2). ◾
The aforementioned proof uses the general idea of convergence stairs first proposed in
[GM91]. The framework uses a finite sequence of predicates H0, H1, H2, …, Hk − 1 for a layered
construction involving a composite algorithm with k layers, where Hj (0 ≤ j ≤ k – 1) is the
predicate that holds after layer j terminates. If Hj is closed under the actions of the layers (j + 1)
through k, then the concurrent execution of the composite algorithm is guaranteed to reach a
configuration that satisfies the postcondition Hk. Here, there are two layers:
1. H0 = ∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5 {postcondition for the dag-generation layer A}
2. H1 = ∀(i, j) : j ∈ succ(i) : c(i) ≠ c(j) {postcondition for the coloring layer B}
These layers satisfy the composition rule of convergence stairs.
10.5 COLE–VISHKIN REDUCTION ALGORITHM FOR TREE COLORING
Consider a graph G = (V, E), and assume that each node v ∈ V has a unique id. Let n = |V|. It
is obvious that by using the ids as node colors, one can always generate a legal node coloring
for G. However, in general, coloring an n-node graph with n colors is hardly interesting.
We therefore present an algorithm for reducing the size of the color palette without violating
the constraint ∀i, j ∈ V: (i, j) ∈ E, c(i) ≠ c(j). It is a synchronous algorithm developed
by
Cole and Vishkin [CV86], and it demonstrates how any rooted tree can be colored using at
most three colors in log*(n) rounds. Let us first understand the log* function:
log*(n) is the
Graph Algorithms ◾ 215
smallest number of log operations needed to bring n down to 2 or less. For example, consider
n = one trillion. Now,
log (one trillion) ≅ 40,
log (log (one trillion)) ≅ 5.322, and
log (log (log (log (one trillion)))) < 2.
This means that log*(one trillion) = 4. This also illustrates that the log* function grows
very slowly with the value of the argument.
The reduction algorithm assumes that initially the color of each node is its id. Each
nonroot node v is aware of its parent p(v). Interpret each color c as a little-endian
bit string ck−1ck−2ck−3…co, and let |c| denote the size of the bit string. In each round,
every nonroot node v synchronously executes its actions. The algorithm terminates
when ∀v ∈ V: c(v) < 6:
program reduce for a rooted tree: actions in each round;
{Program for the root node}
c(root):= 00 followed by bit 0 of c(root)
{Program for each non-root node v}
do c(v) ≥ 6 →
{Let j = smallest index where the bit strings of c(v) and old
c(p(v)) differ}
c(v):= bit string for j followed by bit j of c(v)
od
Figure 10.15 shows an example. Consider the pair of nodes v, w. In Figure 10.15a, for node
w, the minimum bit position in which its color label differs from that of its parent v is bit
position 2. Accordingly, the first part (or the head) of the new label is the binary code
for 2, that is, 10. This is followed by the second part (or the tail) of the color label, which
is the value of bit 2 of node w. This leads to the new color label 100 for node w in the next

round. After each round, the algorithm leads to a valid color label whose size is roughly the
base-2 logarithm of the size of the color label in the previous round. Therefore, in log*(n)
rounds, the algorithm terminates.
Theorem 10.5
Each round of algorithm reduce leads to a valid node coloring.
Proof: The new color label of any nonroot node v has two parts: (1) the head H, which is the
smallest index j where the bit strings of the current c(v) and c(p(v)) differ, and (2) the tail T,
which is the value of bit j of c(v). To prove that the new color labels form a valid coloring, we
need to show that either the H- or the T-component of the new c(v) and c(p(v)) is distinct.
Case 1: After one round, H-components of c(v) and c(p(v)) are not identical. This automatically
leads to a valid coloring.
Case 2: After one round, H-components of c(v) and c(p(v)) are identical. In this case, by
definition, the T-components of c(v) and c(p(v)) must be different. ◾
Why does the algorithm allow up to six colors for the nodes? Observe that as long as the
size of the current color label |c(v)| is ≥ 6, the new color label will shrink in size, and the
program execution will continue to the next round. Once c(v) < 6 holds, the continuation
of the program execution will be useless, since it will not reduce the values of c. At this
point, there will be three choices for the H-component (0, 1, 2) and two choices for the
T-component (0, 1). This leads to a total of six possible colors.
An additional procedure is needed for further reducing the size of the color palette from
six to three. It begins with a push down mechanism that preserves the legality of the colors
but leads to a configuration where all the children of the same parent have the same color.
Thereafter, a simple manipulation of the color labels leads to a valid 3-coloring of the tree.
The shift-down operation is as follows:
The shift-down operation {concurrently executed}
The root picks a color < 6 and different from its current color.
Each nonroot node v concurrently executes c(v):= c(p(v)).
It is trivial to show that shift-down leads to a valid coloring of the tree. Consider a node
v and its parent w = p(v). The current colors are legal, so c(v) ≠ c(w). After the shift-down
operation, c(v) equals the value of old c(w), but node w gets the color of its parent p(w). This
color must be different from the old c(w) and hence must be distinct from the new c(v).
In case w is the root, it chooses a new color, so c(v) ≠ c(w) will hold. Thus, the shift-down
operation guarantees that for every nonroot node v, c(v) ≠ c(p(v)) is true. So, the new color
labels form a valid coloring.
Since the operation c(v) := c(p(v)) makes the colors of all the children of a given node
identical, it opens up the possibility of further reducing the size of the color palette from
Graph Algorithms ◾ 217
six to three. Consider using the colors {0, 1, 2} instead of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Each node has to
find a free color that is different from (a) the color of its parent and (b) the color of its children.
Since there are three colors, such a free color must be available. This forms the basis
of the final reduction scheme:
Reduction of the color palette size from six to three
z:= 3;
do z ≤ 5 →
c(v) = z → pick a color from {0, 1, 2} not used by the
neighbors of v;
z := z + 1
od
This will run for at most three rounds. The shift-down and the palette reduction steps are
shown in Figure 10.16.
It is now possible to put the pieces together as a single algorithm for 3-coloring the
nodes of a tree in O(log*n) rounds:
program 3-coloring of a tree in O(log*n) rounds
{Program for node v}
Execute Algorithm Reduce for log*(n) rounds;
Execute shift-down;
Reduce the color palette size from six to three
The primary merit of the aforementioned algorithm is its near-constant time complexity,
while keeping the size of the color palette close to optimal.

10.6 MAXIMAL INDEPENDENT SET: LUBY’S ALGORITHM
Given a graph G = (V, E), an independent set is a subset of nodes W ⊆ V such that no two
nodes in W are adjacent to one another. An independent set is maximal if no node can be
added to W without violating its independence. Figure 10.17 shows an example.
There are many applications of independent and maximal independent sets (MISs).
Consider the problem of scheduling an examination. In Figure 10.17, assume that each
node represents a course and an edge between a pair of nodes (v, w) denotes that at least one
student has registered for both v and w. Then an independent set denotes which examinations
can be concurrently scheduled. A set of examinations will form an MIS if no additional
examinations can be scheduled at that time.
Note that there is a difference between MIS and maximum independent set. Maximum
independent set refers to the independent set with largest cardinality, and its computation
is NP-hard. We focus only on the MIS.
A simple distributed algorithm for computing the MIS of an undirected connected
graph G = (V, E) is as follows. An initiator node uses a traversal algorithm to send a token
to visit the various nodes of the graph. The token, while visiting a node, determines if the
node can be included in the independent set or not. Nodes that are included in the MIS are
assigned a binary tag: f(v) = 1 means the node v is included in the MIS, and f(v) = 0 means
that the node v is excluded from the MIS. The algorithm is outlined here:
A simple algorithm for computing MIS
{Program for each node v upon receiving a token}
Initially ∀v ∈ V:f(v) = 0
∀w ∈ N(v):f(w) = 0 → f(v):= 1;
Continue with the next node until the traversal is complete;
{The MIS is the set {v ∈ V :f(v)= 1}}
The algorithm is clearly sequential with a time complexity O(|E|) and is not very interesting.
Subsequently, faster algorithms for solving the MIS problem have been devised using the synchronous
round-based model of computation. One such algorithm is due to Luby [Luby86].

Graph Algorithms ◾ 219
Luby’s algorithm is randomized and it operates in synchronous rounds, grouped into
phases. In each phase, every node tries to join the MIS by marking itself with a specific
probability that is related to its degree. A marked node joins the MIS if none of its higherdegree
neighbors is marked. Otherwise, it unmarks itself. Each successful node removes
itself and all its neighboring nodes before the next phase begins. The algorithm terminates
when the remainder set of nodes becomes empty:

od {End of phase}
Note: In any phase, a node v with d(v) = 0 automatically joins the MIS. No marking is
necessary.
We first argue that the algorithm indeed produces an MIS. Steps 2, 3, and 4 affirm that
no two neighboring nodes will join the MIS. Step 5 ensures that if v joins the MIS, then
none of its neighbors will. Since each of the remaining nodes gets a chance to mark itself
and join the MIS, the algorithm terminates when no more eligible nodes are left.
The important question here is, how fast does the algorithm terminate? Let L(v) be the set
of neighbors of v whose degree is larger than d(v). Also let M denote the set of marked nodes.

{Definition of good node}
The inclusion of w into the MIS triggers the removal of node v in step 5. ◾
How many good nodes are there? If we could show that a constant fraction of the nodes is
removed in each phase, then we could claim that the algorithm terminates in O(log n) rounds.
However, this is not necessarily true. In a star graph with n > 4, only the hub is a good node.
To work around this, we prove that a constant fraction of the edges is removed in each
phase. Define a bad edge as one that connects two bad nodes. An edge that is not bad is a
good edge. We now prove the following lemma:
Lemma 10.9
At least half of the edges are good.
Proof (by contradiction): Construct a directed graph from G by directing each edge from
a node towards the higher-degree neighbors (break any tie using node ids). We first show
that for a bad node v: outdegree(v) ≥ 2.indegree(v).

d v ( ) are outgoing edges. Now, define a

. So, in the directed version of G,
at most half of the edges are directed towards bad nodes (Figure 10.18). This means, at least
half of the edges are directed towards nodes that are not bad, that is, good nodes. By definition,
these are good edges. ◾
Theorem 10.6

Proof: Per Lemma 10.8, in each phase, a good node is removed with a constant probability
>1/12. By definition, any edge incident on a good node is a good edge, and when a node
is removed, all of its neighbors (i.e., all edges incident on it) are also removed (step 5).

It follows from Lemma 10.9 that at least half of the edges are removed in each phase. Upon
termination, all the |E| edges will be removed, which will take O(log|E|) phases. Since
|E| ≤ n2 and each phase has a constant number of rounds, the algorithm terminates in an
expected number of O(log n) rounds. ◾

10.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Many applications in distributed computing center around a few common graph
problems—
this chapter addresses a few of basic algorithms. An algorithm is considered
robust, when it works on dynamic graphs, that is, it handles (or survives) changes in
topology. Mobile ad hoc networks add a new dimension to the fragility of the network
topology, because their topologies continuously change due to the limited transmission
range of each node. In recent times, embedded systems have witnessed significant
growth—such systems use sensors that monitor environmental parameters and relay the
values to a base station. The nodes of sensor networks run on limited battery power, so
power consumption is a major issue—a low consumption of power adds to the life of the
system. Therefore, in addition to space, time, and message complexities, a useful performance
metric for sensor networks is the amount of power used by the sensor nodes
during
the execution of an algorithm.
The graphs represent not only physical networks but also logical networks (like overlay
networks), where the neighborhood relationships are user defined and change over time. One
classic example is a social network. The scale of these networks is constantly increasing—for
example, as of 2012, Facebook has nearly 600 million users. As a result, scalability of common
tasks (like multicasting) is a major issue. For an algorithm to be of practical use at that
scale, space and time complexities of at most O(logk n) (k ≥ 1) are considered to be acceptable.
The GHS algorithm for MST construction has been extensively studied in the published
literature. This algorithm is an interesting case study of techniques that are valuable in the
design of many distributed algorithms.
Distance-vector and link-state routings (and their variations) have been the two main
contenders in network routing. Compared to distance-vector algorithm, the link-state
algorithm has the merit that it does not suffer from the counting-to-infinity problem when
there is a change in topology. The main disadvantage of a link-state routing protocol is
that it does not scale well as more routers are added to the routing domain. Increasing the
number of routers increases the size and frequency of the topology updates and also the
length of time it takes to calculate end-to-end routes. This lack of scalability means that a
link-state routing protocol is unsuitable for routing across the Internet at large, which is the
reason why the Internet, for the purpose of routing, is divided into autonomous systems.
Internet Gateway Protocols like OSPF is a link-state protocol that only route traffic within
a single AS. An Exterior Gateway Protocol like BGP routes traffic between autonomous
systems. These are primarily vector routing protocols and are more scalable.
Graph Algorithms ◾ 223
Interval routing is a topic that has generated some interest among theoreticians. It
addresses the scalability problem of routing tables. However, as of now, its limited ability
to adapt to changes in topology restricts its applicability. So far, it has been used only for
communication in some transputer-based distributed systems.* Some attempts of using it
in sensor networks have recently been reported. Compared to interval routing, prefix routing
is much more popular and used in many structured peer-to-peer networks.
Cole and Vishkin’s algorithm for tree coloring introduces a technique for solving a
problem in O(log*n) rounds. This technique has been leveraged to solve a few related problems
in O(log*n) rounds. For example, it is possible to show that a graph with degree D can
be colored with (D + 1) colors in O(log*n) rounds. The proof of Luby’s algorithm for MIS
construction is due to Wattenhofer.
10.8 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Chandy–Misra’s shortest path algorithm [CM82] is an adaptation of the Bellman–Ford
algorithm used with ARPANET during 1969–1979. The adaptation included a mechanism
for termination detection and a mechanism to deal with negative edge weights. The
link-state routing algorithm also originated from ARPANET and was first proposed by
McQuillan et al. and is described in [MRC80]. After several modifications, it was adopted
by the ISO as an OSPF protocol. Santoro and Khatib [SK85] introduced interval routing.
This chapter demonstrated the feasibility for tree topologies only. Van Leeuwen and Tan
[LT87] extended the idea to nontree topologies. The probe algorithm for computing the
spanning tree is originally due to Chang [Ch82]—Segall [Se83] presented a slightly different
version of it. In [GHS83], Gallager et al. presented their MST algorithm—it has been
extensively studied in the field of distributed algorithms, and many different correctness
proofs have been proposed. Tarry’s traversal algorithm [Ta1895], proposed for exploring an
unknown graph, is one of the oldest known distributed algorithms. The distributed algorithm
for coloring planar graphs is due to Ghosh and Karaata [GK93]—the original paper
proposed a self-stabilizing algorithm for the problem. The version presented in this chapter
is a simplification of that algorithm. Luby’s algorithm for constructing an MIS can be
found in [Luby86]; the complexity analysis presented here is due to Wattenhofer [Lecture
notes: Chapter 12: Summer 2003], who attributes it to a technique taken from Israeli and
Itai developed for solving matching problems.
EXERCISES
10.1 Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. A maximal strongly connected component of G
is a subgraph G′ = (V′, E′) such that (1) for every pair of vertices u, v ∈ V′, there is a
directed path from u to v and a directed path from v to u and (2) no other subgraph
of G has G′ as its subgraph. Propose a distributed algorithm to compute the maximal
strongly connected component of a graph.
* Transputers were introduced by INMOS as building blocks of distributed systems.
224 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
10.2 Consider the graph in Figure 10.19, where each edge is labeled with the signal
propagation
delay on that edge. With node 0 as the initiator, execute Chang’s
algorithm
and compute the spanning tree of this graph. Assume that nodes forward
the probes as soon as they receive it, and local computation takes zero time. Also
determine how much time it will take to generate the spanning tree.
10.3 Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph and let V′ ⊂ V represent the membership of
a group. The members of V′ want to communicate with one another via a multicast
tree, which is a minimal subgraph of G containing all members of V′—between any
two members of the group, there is exactly one simple path, and if you remove a single
node or edge from the multicast tree, that at least one member of the group becomes
unreachable.
a. For the graph in Figure 10.19, show a multicast tree for V′ = {0, 5, 6, 7}.
b. Given a graph G and a subset V′ of k nodes, suggest a distributed algorithm for
constructing a multicast tree. Briefly argue why your solution will work.
10.4 In a spanning tree of a graph, there is exactly one path between any pair of nodes.
If a spanning tree is used for broadcasting a message and a node crashes, then some
nodes will not be able to receive the broadcast. Our goal is to improve the connectivity
of the subgraph used for broadcast, so that it can tolerate the crash of a single
node. Such a subgraph is a biconnected subgraph of the given graph.
Given the graph in Figure 10.19, give an example of such a minimal graph. Then
suggest a distributed algorithm for constructing such a subgraph. Argue why your
algorithm will work.
10.5 In most of the algorithms for rooted spanning tree generation, only one designated
process can be the initiator. For the sake of speedup, consider a modification
where there are more than one initiator nodes. Explain your strategy and illustrate
a construction
with two initiators. Does it lead to speedup? Justify your answer.
10.6 Devise an interval-labeling scheme for optimal routing on a (1) 4 × 4 grid of 16 processes
and (2) a 3-cube of 8 processes. For each topology, show three test cases to
show that the routes are optimal.

when a single node crashes. Your algorithm should complete the repair by adding
the fewest number of edges. Compute the time complexity of your algorithm.

b. Propose a prefix routing scheme for the following two networks. In each case, you
have to label the nodes (not the ports) of the graph in such a way that a message

spanning tree in O(n) time, where n = |V|.
(Hint: When the empty message m visits a node i for the first time, it lets every nonparent
neighbor j know that it has been visited. The token is not forwarded until it
has received an acknowledgment from node j. Since j knows that i has been visited,
it will not forward the token to i.) Show your analysis of the time and the message
complexities.

two edges are incident on the same vertex. A matching M is called maximal if there
is no other matching M′ ⊃ M. Suggest a distributed algorithm for computing a maximal
matching. When the algorithm terminates, each node must know its matching
neighbor, if such a match exists.

Coordination Algorithms
11.1 INTRODUCTION
Distributed applications rely on specific forms of coordination among processes to accomplish
their goals. Some tasks of coordination can be viewed as a form of preprocessing. Examples
include clock synchronization, spanning tree construction, and leader election. In this section,
we single out a couple of specific coordination algorithms and explain their construction. Our
first example addresses leader election, where one among a designated set of processes is chosen
as leader and assigned special responsibilities. The second example addresses a problem of
model transformation: Recall that asynchrony is hard to deal with in real-life applications due
to the lack of temporal guarantees—it is simpler to write algorithms on the synchronous process
model (where processes execute actions in lockstep synchrony) and easier to prove their
correctness. This motivates the design of synchronizers that transform an asynchronous model
into a synchronous one and help run synchronous algorithms on asynchronous systems. In this
section, we will discuss several algorithms for leader election and synchronizer construction.
11.2 LEADER ELECTION
A wide variety of distributed applications rely on the existence of a leader among its constituent
process. The leader is invariably the focus of control and entrusted with the responsibility of
system-wide management. Consider the client–server model of resource management: Here, the
server can be viewed as a leader. Client processes send requests for resources to the server, and
based on the information maintained by the server, a request may be either granted or deferred
or denied. As another example, consider a centralized database manager—the shared data can
be accessed or updated by client processes in the system. This manager maintains a queue of
pending read and writes and processes these requests in an appropriate order. Such a centralization
of control is not essential, but it offers a simple solution with manageable complexity.
When the leader (i.e., coordinator) fails or becomes unreachable, a new leader is
elected from among nonfaulty processes. Failures affect the topology of the system—even
the partitioning of the system into a number of disjoint subsystems is not ruled out.
For a partitioned system, some applications elect a leader from each connected component.
When the partitions merge, a single leader remains, and others drop out.
228 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
It is tempting to compare leader election with the problem of mutual exclusion and use
a mutual exclusion algorithm for electing a leader. They are not exactly equivalent: The
similarity is that whichever process enters the critical section becomes the leader. However,
there are three major differences between the two paradigms:
1. Failure is not an inherent part of mutual exclusion algorithms. In fact, failure within
the critical section is typically ruled out.
2. Starvation is an irrelevant issue in leader election. Processes need not take turns to be
the leader. The system can happily function for an indefinite period with its original
leader, as long as there is no failure.
3. If leader election is viewed from the perspective of mutual exclusion, then exit from
the critical section is unnecessary. On the other hand, the leader needs to inform
every active process about its identity, which is a nonissue in mutual exclusion.
A formal specification of leader election follows: Let G = (V, E) represent the system
topology, and each process i ∈ V has a unique identifier. Each process i has a variable L(i)
that represents the identifier of its leader. Also, let ok(i) denote the predicate that process i
is nonfaulty. Then, the following three conditions must hold:
1. ∀i, j ∈ V: ok(i) ∧ ok(j) ⇒ L(i) = L(j)
2. L(i) ∈ V
3. ok(L(i)) = true
11.2.1 Bully Algorithm
The bully algorithm is due to Garcia–Molina [G82] and works on a completely connected
network of processes. It assumes that (1) communication links are fault-free, (2) processes
can only fail by stopping, and (3) failures can be correctly detected using some mechanism
like time-out. Once a failure of the current leader is detected, the bully algorithm allows
the nonfaulty process with largest id to eventually elect itself as the leader.
The algorithm uses three different types of messages: election, reply, and leader. A process
initiates the election by sending an election message to every other process with a higher id.
By sending this message, a process effectively asks, “Can I be the new leader?” A reply
message is a response to the election message. To a receiving process, a reply implies, “No,
you cannot be the leader.” Finally, a process sends a leader message when it believes that it
is the leader. The algorithm can be outlined as follows:
Step 1: Any process, after detecting the failure of the leader, bids for being the new
leader by sending an election message to every process with a higher identifier.
Step 2: If any process with a higher id responds with a reply message, then the requesting
process gives up its bid for becoming the leader. Subsequently, it waits to receive a
leader message (I am the leader) from some process with a higher identifier.
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 229
Step 3: If no higher-numbered process responds to the election message sent by node i
within a time-out period, then node i elects itself as the leader and sends a leader
message to every process in the system.
Step 4: If no leader message is received by process i within a time-out period after
receiving a reply to its election message, then process i suspects that the winner of the
election failed in the mean time and reinitiates the election.
program bully {program for process i}
define failed : Boolean {set if the failure of the leader is detected}
L: process {identifies the leader}
m: message {election | leader | reply}
state : idle | wait for reply | wait for leader
initially ∀i ∈ V state = idle, failed = false
do failure of L(i) detected ∧ failed:= false → failed:= true
[] failed → ∀j > i:send election to j; state := wait for reply;
failed:= false
[] (state = idle) ∧ (m = election) → send reply to sender; failed := true
[](state = wait for reply) ∧ (m = reply) → state := wait for leader
[](state = wait for reply) ∧ timeout → L(i): =i; state := idle;
send leader to all
[] (m = leader) → L(i): =sender; state := idle
[](state = wait for leader) ∧ timeout → failed:= true; state := idle
od
Theorem 11.1
Every nonfaulty process eventually elects a unique leader.
Proof: A process i sending out an election message may or may not receive a reply.
Case 1: If i receives a reply, then i will not send the leader message. In that case, ∀j ∈ V, L(j) ≠ i
will eventually hold.
Case 2: If i does not receive a reply, then i must be unique in as much ∀j ∈ V: ok(j), j ≤ i
holds. Note that there will always be a process like this. In this case, i elects itself as the
leader, and after the leader message is sent out by i and received by all nonfaulty processes,
the condition ∀j ∈ V: ok(j), L(j) = i holds.
If case 1 holds, but no leader message is subsequently received before time-out, then the
would-be leader itself must have failed in the mean time. This sets failed to true for every
process that was waiting for the leader message. As a result, a new election is initiated and
one of the earlier two cases will eventually hold, unless every process has failed, and the
problem becomes vacuous. ◾
Message complexity: Each process i (except the process with the largest id) can send an election
message to (n − i) other processes. Also, each process j receiving an election message
230 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
can potentially send the reply message to (j − 1) processes. If the would-be leader does
not fail in the mean time, then it sends out (n − 1) leader messages. However, in the worst
case, the would-be leader can also fail before sending the leader messages. In this case, a
time-out occurs, and every process repeats the first two steps. Since out of the n processes
at most (n − 1) can fail, the first two steps can be repeated O(n) times. Thus, the worst-case
message complexity of the bully algorithm is O(n3).
11.2.2 Maxima Finding on a Ring
Once we disregard failures and fault detection,* the task of leader election reduces to finding
a node with a unique (like maximum or minimum) id. While the bully algorithm works
on a completely connected graph, there are several algorithms for maxima finding that are
designed to work on ring topologies. These solutions are conceptually simple, but differ
from one another in message complexity. We will discuss three algorithms in this section.
11.2.2.1 Chang–Roberts Algorithm
In [CR79], Chang and Roberts presented a leader election algorithm for a unidirectional
ring—it is an improvement over the first such algorithm proposed by LeLann [Le77].
Assume that a process can have one of two colors: red or black. Initially, every process is
red, which implies that every process is a potential candidate for being the leader. A red
process initiates the election by sending a token, which means, I want to be the leader. Any
number of red processes can initiate the election. If, however, a process receives a token
before initiating the algorithm, then it knows that there are other processes running for
leadership—so it quits and turns black. A black process never turns red and acts as a router.
At the end, only one process remains red, and it is the leader.
program Chang-Roberts
define token: process id, color ∈ {red,black}
initially all processes are red and i sends a token 〈i〉 to its neighbor;
(for a red process i)
do token 〈j〉 received ∧ (j < i)→ skip {j’s token removed, so j quits}
[]token 〈j〉 received ∧ (j > i)→ send 〈j〉; color := black {i quits}
[]token 〈j〉 received ∧ (j = i)−L(i):=i {i becomes the leader}
od
{for a black process}
do token 〈j〉 received → send 〈j〉 od
Let us examine why the algorithm works. A token initiated by a red process j will be
removed when it is received by a process i > j. So ultimately, the token from a process with
the largest id will prevail and will return to the initiator. Thus, the process with the largest
id elects itself as the leader. It will require another round of leader messages to inform the
identity of the leader to every other process.
To analyze the complexity of the algorithm, consider Figure 11.1. Assume that every process
is an initiator, and their tokens are sent in the anticlockwise direction around the ring.
* We will deal with failures in Chapters 12 through 17.
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 231
Before the token from process (n − 1) reaches the next process (n − 2), the tokens from every
other process reach node (n − 1) in the following order: Token〈0〉 reaches (n − 1), token〈1〉
reaches (n − 1), token〈2〉 reaches (n − 1), and, finally, token〈n−2〉 reaches (n − 1), and all
these tokens get removed. The worst-case message complexity is therefore 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯
+(n − 1) = n(n − 1)/2.
The algorithm can be naturally extended to an arbitrary graph topology for which a
Hamiltonian cycle exists.
11.2.2.2 Franklin’s Algorithm
Franklin’s election algorithm works on a ring that allows bidirectional communication.
Compared to Chang–Robert’s algorithm, it has a lower message complexity. Processes with
unique identifiers are arranged in an arbitrary order in the ring. There are two possible
colors for each process: red or black. Initially, each process is red which implies that every
process is a potential candidate for leadership.
The algorithm is synchronous and works in rounds. In each round, to bid for leadership,
each red process sends a token containing its unique id to both neighbors and then examines
the tokens received from other processes. As process i receives a token from process j and j > i,
it quits the race and turns black. A black process remains passive and acts as a router only.
Since tokens are sent in both directions, whenever two adjacent red processes exchange
tokens, one of them must turn black. In each round, a fraction of the existing red processes
turn black. The algorithm terminates when there is only one red process in the entire system.
This is the leader. The program for a red process i is as follows:
program Franklin
define token: process id, color ∈ {red,black}, r: integer {round number}
initially all processes are red, r = 0 and i sends a token 〈i〉 to its neighbor;
{for a red process i in round r ≥ 0}
send token〈i〉 to both neighbors;
receive token〈j〉 from both neighbors;
if ∃ token〈j〉:j > i → color := black
[]∀ token〈j〉:j < i → r: = r + 1 {move to the next round}
[]∀ token〈j〉:j = i → L(i): = i {algorithm terminates}

process 3 reached process (n − 1) and processes 2 and 1 turned black.
232 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Theorem 11.2
Franklin’s algorithm elects a unique leader in at most (1 + log2n) rounds.
Proof: For a red process i, in each of the two directions, define a red neighbor to be a red
process that is closest to i in that direction. Thus, in Figure 11.2, after round 0, processes 7
and 9 are the two red neighbors of the process 2.
After each round, every red process i that has at least one red neighbor j > i turns black.
Therefore, in a ring with k (k > 1) red processes, at least ⌊k/2⌋ turn black. Initially, k = n.
Therefore, after at most log2n rounds, the number of red processes is reduced to one. In the
next round, it becomes the leader. ◾
The algorithm terminates in O(log2n) rounds, and in each round, every process sends
(or forwards) a message in both directions. Therefore, the worst-case message complexity
of Franklin’s algorithm is O(n ⋅ logn).
11.2.2.3 Peterson’s Algorithm
Like Franklin’s algorithm, Peterson’s algorithm works on a ring topology and operates in
synchronous rounds. Interestingly, it elects a leader using only O(n ⋅ logn) messages even
though it runs on a unidirectional ring. Compared to Franklin’s algorithm, there are two
distinct differences:
1. A process communicates using an alias that changes from one round to another during
the progress of the computation.
2. A unique leader is eventually elected, but that is not necessarily the process with the
largest identifier in the system.
As before, we assume that processes can have two colors: red or black. Initially, every process
is red. A red process turns black when it quits the race for becoming a leader. A black
process is passive—it only acts as a router and forwards incoming messages to its neighbor.
Assume that the ring is oriented in the clockwise direction. Any process will designate
its anticlockwise neighbor as the predecessor and its clockwise neighbor as the successor.

process 9 is identified as the leader (maxima).
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 233
Designate the red predecessor (the closest red process in the anticlockwise direction) of i
by N(i) and the red predecessor of N(i) by NN(i). Until a leader is elected, in each round,
every red process i receives two messages: one from N(i) and the other from NN(i)—these
messages contain aliases of the senders. The channels are FIFO. Depending on the relative
values of the aliases, a red process either decides to continue with a new alias to the next
round or quits the race by turning black.
Denote the alias of a process i by alias(i). Initially, alias(i) = i. The idea is comparable to
that in Franklin’s algorithm, but unlike Franklin’s algorithm, a process cannot receive a
message from both neighbors. So, each process determines the local maxima by comparing
alias(N) with its own alias and alias(NN). If alias(N) happens to be larger than the other
two, then the process continues its run for leadership by assuming alias(N) as its new alias.
Otherwise, it turns black and quits. In each round, every red process executes the following
program:
program Peterson{for a process in each round}
define alias: process id, color: black or red
initially ∀i:color(i)=red, alias(i)=i
send alias; receive alias(N);
if alias = alias(N)→ I am the leader
[]alias ≠ alias(N)→ send alias(N); receive alias(NN);
if alias(N) > max (alias,alias(NN))→ alias:=alias(N)

next round}

234 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Proof of correctness
Let i be a red process before round r(r ≥ 0) begins. Then, after round r, process i remains red
if and only if the following condition holds:
LocalMax  alias(N(i)) > alias(i)alias(N(i)) > alias(NN(i))
We show that in each round, at least one of the two red processes i and N(i) will turn black.
Lemma 11.2
Let i be a red process, and j = N(i) before a round begins. Then at the end of the round,
either i or j must turn black.
Proof (by contradiction): Assume that the statement is false. Then both i and j will remain
red after that round. From LocalMax, it follows that if i remains red after that round, then
alias(j) > alias(i) ∧ alias(j) > alias(N(j)) must hold. Again, if j remains red after that round,
then alias(N(j)) > alias(j) ∧ alias(N(j)) > alias(NN(j)) must also hold. Both of these cannot
hold at the same time, so the statement is true. ◾
It is not impossible for two or more neighboring red processes to turn black in the same
round (see Figure 11.3). In fact, this helps our case and accelerates the convergence.
Theorem 11.3
Peterson’s algorithm elects a unique leader at most (1 + log2n) rounds.
Proof: It follows from Lemma 11.2 that after every round, at least half of the existing red
processes turn black. So, after at most log2n rounds, only one red process i remains, i = N(i),
and the condition alias(i)=alias(N(i)) holds. In the next round, process i elects itself as the
leader. ◾
Message complexity: Since there are at most (1 + log2n) rounds, and in each round every
process sends (or forwards) two messages, the number of messages required to elect a
leader is bounded from above by O(n ⋅ log2n). Despite the fact that the communication
is unidirectional, the message complexity is not inferior to that found in Franklin’s algorithm
for a bidirectional ring.
11.2.3 Election in Arbitrary Networks
For general networks, if a ring is embedded on the given topology, then a ring algorithm can
be used for leader election. The orientation of the embedded ring helps messages propagate in
a predefined manner. As an alternative, one can use flooding to construct a leader election.
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 235
Assume that the algorithm runs in rounds. Initially, ∀i ∈ V: L(i) = i. In each round, each
node i sends its L(i) to every node j ∈ N(i). After a node i received the messages from its
neighbors, it picks the largest id from the set {L(i) ∪ L(j): j ∈ N(i)}, assigns it to L(i), and
sends the updated L(i) to its neighbors. The algorithm will terminate after D rounds, where
D is the diameter of the graph. Here is an outline:
program election in an arbitrary network {for each process i}
define r: integer {round number},L: process id {identifies the leader}
initially r = 0, L(i)=i
do r < D→
send L(i) to each j ∈ N(i);
receive L(j) from each j ∈ N(i);
L(i):= max{L(i)∪L(j:j ∈ N(i)}
r: =r + 1
od
The algorithm requires processes to know the diameter (or at least the total number of
processes) of the network. The message complexity is O(Δ ⋅ D) where Δ is the maximum
degree of a node.
11.2.4 Election in Anonymous Networks
In anonymous networks, process identifiers are not used. Therefore, the task of leader election
becomes an exercise in symmetry breaking. Randomization is a widely used tool for
breaking symmetry. Here, we present a randomized leader election algorithm that uses
a single bit b(i) for each process. Algorithm works in synchronous rounds and works on
completely connected networks only.
A process can be in one of two states: active or passive. Initially, every process is active
and is a contender for leadership. In each round, each active process i randomly chooses
a value for b(i) from the set {0,1}. Define the set S = {i: b(i) = 1}. If |S| = 1, then process i ∈ S
becomes the leader, and the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, the processes in S move
to the next round, and those not belonging to S become passive and quit the race. This
reduces the competition. There is one exception: When ∀i,j: b(i) = b(j), no progress is
made, and all processes must repeat the random selection. However, this event cannot
continue forever, and in a bounded number of rounds, the condition ∃i,j: b(i) ≠ b(j) will
hold. The active processes moving to the next round continue the algorithm, until one
process is elected as the leader. The description of the algorithm uses ids for the purpose
of identification only.
Note that after each round, half of the processes are expected to advance to the next
round. So in a system of n processes, a leader is elected after an expected number of logn
rounds. Since in each round, every active process communicates with every other active
process, the message complexity is O(n2 logn).
236 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach

11.3 SYNCHRONIZERS
Compared to synchronous algorithms, asynchronous algorithms are often more difficult
to design and analyze and have a higher complexity. Since most distributed computing
platforms are naturally asynchronous, it is tempting to devise a mechanism by which synchronous
algorithm could be run on asynchronous platforms. A synchronizer is a protocol
that transforms an asynchronous model into a synchronous process model (i.e., processes
operate in lockstep synchrony) and enables synchronous algorithms to run on it. A synchronous
algorithm runs in discrete steps known as rounds or clock ticks (a.k.a. clock
pulse). In each tick, a process can
• Perform a local computation
• Send out messages to its neighbors and receive messages from its neighbors
Messages sent out in clock tick i are assumed to reach their destinations in the same
clock tick—based on these, processes update their states in the next clock tick (i + 1).
A synchronizer performs the model transformation by simulating the synchronous rounds
on an asynchronous network. This results in a two-layered design. Synchronizers provide
an alternative technique for designing algorithms on asynchronous distributed systems.
Assume that each node has a clock pulse generator and these clocks tick in unison. Actions
are scheduled with these clock ticks. The implementation of a synchronizer must guarantee
the condition that a new pulse is generated at a node only after it receives all the messages
of the synchronous algorithm, sent by its neighbors at the previous pulse. However,
the difficulty in providing this guarantee is that no node knows which messages were sent
to it by its neighbors, and the message propagation delays can be arbitrarily large.
Contrary to apprehensions about the complexity of the two-layered algorithm, the complexity
figures of algorithms using synchronizers are quite encouraging. In this chapter, we
will present the design of a few basic types of synchronizers.
11.3.1 ABD Synchronizer
An asynchronous bounded delay (ABD) synchronizer [CCGZ90] [TKZ94] can be implemented
on a network where every process has a physical clock, and the message propagation
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 237
delays have a known upper bound δ. In real life, all physical clocks tend to drift. However,
to keep our discussion simple, we assume that once initialized, the difference between a
pair of physical clocks does not change during the life of the computation.
Let C denote the physical clock of a process. One or more processes spontaneously initiate
the synchronizer actions by assigning C:= 0, executing the actions for tick (0), and sending
a <start> signal to its neighbors (Figure 11.4). By assumption, actions take zero time. Each
noninitiating neighbor j wakes up when it receives the <start> signal from a neighbor, initializes
its clock C to 0, and executes the actions for tick 0. This completes the initialization.
Before a process p simulates the actions of tick(i + 1), p along with its neighbors must
send and receive all messages corresponding to tick i. If p sends the <start> message to q,
q wakes up and sends a message that is a part of initialization actions of tick 0, then p will
receive it at time ≤2δ. Therefore, process p will start the simulation of the next pulse (tick 1)
at time 2δ. Eventually, process p will simulate tick k of the synchronous algorithm at local
clock time 2kδ. The permission to start the simulation of a tick thus entirely depends on
the local clock value.
11.3.2 Awerbuch’s Synchronizers
When neither the physical clocks are synchronized nor the upper bound of the message
propagation delays is known, the ABD synchronizer does not work. In [Aw85], Awerbuch
addressed the design of synchronizers for such weaker models and proposed three different
kinds of synchronizers with varying message and time complexities.
The key idea behind Awerbuch’s synchronizers is the determination of when a process is
safe to schedule the actions of the next clock tick. By definition, a process is safe for a given
clock tick when (1) it has received an ack for every message that it sent during the current
tick and (2) its neighbors have sent out their messages for the current tick. A safe process
announces this by sending a <safe> message to its neighbors. A violation of this policy may
prompt a process to start scheduling the actions of tick (j + 1) before receiving a message for
tick j from a neighbor. Here, we describe three different types of synchronizers. Each has a
different strategy for using the topological information and detecting safe configurations.
11.3.2.1 α-Synchronizer
Before incrementing tick, each node needs to ensure that it is safe to do so. The
α-synchronizer implements this by asking each process to send a <safe> message after

the synchronizer operation, initialize themselves, and send start signals to the noninitiators 0 and 2;
(b) 0 and 2 wake up and complete the initialization. This completes the action of tick 0.
238 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
it has sent and received all messages for the current clock tick. Each process executes the
following three steps for the simulation tick i:
1. Send and receive messages <m,i> for the current tick i.
2. Send <ack,i> for each incoming message, and receive <ack,i> for each outgoing message
for the current tick i.
3. Send <safe,i> to each neighbor.
When a process receives <safe,i> messages from every neighbor for tick i, it increments its
tick to (i + 1) and starts the simulation of tick (i + 1). Figure 11.5 shows a partial trace of the
execution of the α-synchronizer.
Complexity issues: For the α-synchronizer, the message complexity M(α) is the number of messages
passed around the entire network for the simulation of each tick. It is easy to observe
that M(α) = O(|E|)—in addition to the original messages of the synchronous algorithm, two
other messages <ack> and <safe> are sent through every edge of the network. Similarly,
the time complexity T(α) is the maximum number of asynchronous rounds required by the
synchronizer to simulate each tick across the entire network. Since each process exchanges
three messages <m>,<ack>,<safe> for every round of the synchronous algorithm, T(α) = 3.

Coordination Algorithms ◾ 239
Let MS and TS be, respectively, the message and the time complexities of a synchronous
distributed algorithm. Then using a synchronizer, the same algorithm can be implemented
on an asynchronous model with a message complexity MA and a time complexity
TA where

It is possible that in the original synchronous algorithm, one or more processes do not
send out a message to its neighbors in one or more rounds. However, in these rounds, the
α-synchronizer must send out a blank message on behalf of these processes.
11.3.2.2 β-Synchronizer
The β-synchronizer needs an initialization phase before the simulation of the clock ticks
begins. The initialization phase involves constructing a spanning tree of the network.
A designated initiator is the root of the spanning tree. The initiator starts the simulation
by sending out to its children a next message that prompts them to start the simulation
for tick 0. Thereafter, the operations are similar to those in the α-synchronizer, except that
the control messages (next, safe, and ack) are sent along the tree edges only. A safe process
sends a <safe,i> message to its parent to indicate that the entire subtree under it is safe for
tick i. If the root receives a <safe,i> message from each child, then it knows that every node
in the spanning tree is safe for tick i—so it sends a next message to start the simulation of
the next tick (i + 1).
The message complexity M(β) can be estimated as follows. Each process exchanges the
following messages:
1. Sends and receives messages <m,i> for tick i to and from its neighbors.
2. Sends and receives <ack,i> to and from its neighbors. Thereafter it sends a <safe,i>
message to its parent.
3. Receives a <safe,i> message from each child via the tree edges. The safe signals are
convergecast via tree edges. If the process itself is safe, and it is not the root, then it
sends a safe message to its parent.
4. When the root receives the safe messages from every child, it knows that the entire
tree is safe. Then it sends out a <next,(i+1)> message via the tree edges to the nodes of
the network. After receiving the <next,(i+1)> message, a node begins the simulation
of tick (i + 1).
In a spanning tree of a graph with n nodes, there are (n − 1) edges. The three control
messages (ack, safe, next) flow through each of the (n − 1) tree edges. So, the extra message
complexity is M(β) = O(n). The time complexity T(β) is proportional to the height of the
tree, which is at most (n − 1), but often much smaller when the tree is balanced.
240 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The method of computing the complexity of an asynchronous algorithm using a
β-synchronizer is similar to that using the α-synchronizer, except that there is an overhead
for the construction of the spanning tree. This is a one-time overhead, and its complexity
depends on the algorithm chosen for it.
11.3.2.3 γ-Synchronizer
Comparing the α-synchronizer with the β-synchronizer, we observe that the β-synchronizer
has a lower message complexity, but the α-synchronizer has a lower time complexity. The
γ-synchronizer utilizes the best features of both β- and α-synchronizers.
In a γ-synchronizer, there is an initialization phase, during which the network is divided
into clusters of processes. Each cluster is a subgraph containing a subset of processes. The
β-synchronizer protocol is used to synchronize the processes within each cluster, whereas
the α-synchronizer is used to synchronize processes between clusters. To implement this
idea, each cluster identifies a leader—it acts as the root of a spanning tree for that cluster.
Neighboring clusters communicate with one another through a designated edge known as
an intercluster edge (see Figure 11.6).
Using the β-synchronizer protocol, when the leader of a cluster finds that each process
in the cluster is safe, it broadcasts to all processes in the cluster that the cluster is safe.
Processes incident on the intercluster edges forward this information to the neighboring
clusters using a cluster.safe message. The nodes receiving the cluster.safe message from the
neighboring clusters convey to their leaders that the neighboring clusters are safe. The
sending of a cluster.safe message from the leader of one cluster to the leader of a neighboring
cluster simulates the sending of a safe message from one node to its neighbor in the
α-synchronizer.
FIGURE 11.6 Clusters in a γ-synchronizer: The shaded nodes are the leaders in the clusters, and
the thick lines are the intercluster edges between clusters.
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 241
We now compute the message and time complexities of a γ-synchronizer. Partition the
graph G = (V, E) into a number of clusters; adjacent clusters are connected by a set of preferred
edges called intercluster edges. Within a cluster, the coordination progresses in the
usual way. The intercluster coordination is carried out using the following control messages
for clock tick i:
1. A <safe,i> message is sent to the parent, after a <safe,i> message is received from all
children in the cluster. When the leader in a cluster receives the <safe,i> messages
from every child, it knows that the entire cluster is safe. To advertise this, the leader
broadcasts a <cluster.safe,i> message to every node in the cluster via the spanning tree.
2. When a node incident on the intercluster edge receives the <cluster.safe,i> message
from its parent, it forwards that message to the neighboring cluster(s) through the
intercluster edges to indicate that this cluster is safe.
3. The nodes receiving the <cluster.safe,i> message from the neighboring clusters convergecast
it toward their leaders via the tree edges. The leader of a cluster eventually
learns about the receipt of the <cluster.safe,i> messages from every neighboring cluster.
At this time, the leader broadcasts the next message to the nodes in its cluster, and
the simulation of the next tick (i + 1) begins.
Table 11.1 shows the chronology of the various control signals. Here, let T be the time when
the simulation of the current clock starts and Hp be the maximum height of the spanning
tree in each cluster for the given partition, and let each hop take 1 unit of time.
It follows from Table 11.1 that the time complexity of γ-synchronizer is 4Hp + 3. To compute
the message complexity, let Ep represent the set of all tree edges and intercluster edges in
a given partition P of the network. Through each tree edge within a cluster, the messages ack,
safe, cluster.safe, and next are sent out exactly once. In addition, through each intercluster
edge, the message cluster.safe is sent twice, once in each direction. Therefore, the message
complexity of the γ-synchronizer is O(|Ep|). Note that if there is a single cluster, then the
γ-synchronizer reduces to a β-synchronizer. On the other hand, if each node is treated as a
cluster, then the γ-synchronizer reduces to an α-synchronizer. To reduce both time and space
complexities of a γ-synchronizer, it is important to look for a partition so that both Ep and Hp
are small. In [Aw85], Awerbuch presented a partition algorithm that leads to Ep ≤ k ⋅ n and
Hp ≤ logn/logk, where n = |V| and 2 ≤ k < n. To compute the overall complexity, one should

T + Hp + 2 Leaders receive <safe> messages and find that their clusters are safe.
T + 2Hp + 2 Processes in a cluster receive <cluster.safe> message from the leader.
T + 2Hp + 3 <cluster.safe> is received from (and sent to) neighboring clusters.
T + 3Hp + 3 The leaders receive the <cluster.safe> message.
T + 4Hp + 3 All processes receive the <next> message and simulate the next tick.
242 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
also take into account the initial one-time overhead of building these clusters, designating the
intercluster edges, and computing the spanning trees within each cluster.
11.3.2.4 Performance of Synchronizer-Based Algorithms
The use of a synchronizer for running synchronous algorithms on asynchronous systems
does not necessarily incur a significant performance penalty. To demonstrate this, consider
a synchronous BFS algorithm, and transform it to an asynchronous version using a
synchronizer. The synchronous algorithm works as follows:
1. A designated root starts the algorithm by sending a probe to each neighbor in tick 0.
2. All nodes at distance d(d > 0) receive the first probe in tick (d − 1) and forward that
probe to all neighbors (other than the sender) in tick d.
3. The algorithm terminates when every node has received a probe, and the BFS tree
consists of all edges through which nodes received their first probes.
The BFS tree is computed in D rounds (where D is the diameter of the graph), and it requires
MS = O(|E|) messages.
Now, consider running this algorithm on an asynchronous system using an
α-synchronizer—the synchronizer will simulate the clock ticks, and the action of the synchronous
algorithm will be scheduled at the appropriate ticks. Since T(α) = 3, the time
complexity of the overall algorithm is TA = TS ⋅ T(α) = 3D asynchronous rounds. Also,
M(α) = O(|E|), so the message complexity of the composite algorithm will be

Compare these figures with the complexities of a solution to the same problem without using
the synchronizer. A straightforward algorithm for the asynchronous model starts in the same
way as the synchronous version, but the additional complexity is caused by the arbitrary
propagation delays of the channels. It is possible that a node receives a probe from some node
with distance d and assigns to itself a distance (d + 1) but later receives another probe from a

node with a distance less than d, thus revoking the earlier decision. It is possible to devise an
asynchronous algorithm than constructs a BFS tree in O(n2) time using O(n2) messages. As
another example, consider the asynchronous Bellman–Ford algorithm whose time complexity
is 2O(n) steps. The synchronous version of the Bellman–Ford algorithm has a time complexity
of TS = O(n) ⋅ O(|E|) rounds—so by running a synchronous Bellman–Ford algorithm on
an α-synchronizer, it is possible to reduce the time complexity to O(n3) asynchronous rounds.
11.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Numerous types of coordination problems find use in the design of distributed applications.
In this section, we singled out two such problems with different flavors.
Extrema (i.e., maxima of minima) finding is a simple abstraction of the problem of leader
election, since it disregards failures. The problem becomes more difficult, when failures or
mobility affects the network topology. For example, if a mobile ad hoc network failure gets
partitioned into two disjoint components, then separate leaders need to be defined for each
connected component to sustain a reduced level of performance. Upon merger, one of the
two leaders will relinquish leadership. Algorithms addressing such issues differ in message
complexities and depend on topological assumptions.
Synchronizer is an example of simulation. Such simulations preserve the constraints of the
original system on a per node (i.e., local) basis, but may not provide any global guarantee. An
example of a local constraint is that no node in a given tick will accept a message for a different
tick from another node. A global constraint for a truly synchronous behavior is that when one
node executes the actions of tick k, then every other node will execute the actions of the same
tick. One can observe that the α-synchronizer does not satisfy this requirement, since a node
at distance d > 1 may simulate an action of an earlier (or a later) clock tick. This hardly has an
impact on the correctness of the simulation, since no node communicates with nonneighbors.
11.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
LeLann [Le77] presented the first solution to the maxima finding problem: Every initiator
generates a token and sends to its neighbors, and a neighbor forwards a token when its own
id is lower than that of the initiator; otherwise, it forwards a token with its own id. This leads
to a message complexity of O(n2). Chang and Roberts algorithm [CR79] is an improvement
over LeLann’s algorithm—its worst-case message complexity is O(n2), but its average-case
complexity is O(n · logn). Garcia–Molina [G82] proposed the bully algorithm. Hirschberg
and Sinclair [HS80] described the first algorithm for leader election on a bidirectional ring.
Their algorithm had a message complexity of O(n · logn), the constant factor being approximately
8. Franklin’s algorithm [F82] had an identical complexity measure, but the constant
was reduced to 2. Peterson’s algorithm [P82] was the first algorithm on a unidirectional ring
with a message complexity O(n · logn) with a constant factor of 2. Subsequent modifications
lowered this constant factor. The randomized algorithm for leader election is a simplification
of the stabilizing version presented by Dolev et al. in [DIM91].
Chou et al. [CCGZ90] and subsequently Tel et al. [TKZ94] studied the design of synchronization
on the ABD model of networks. The α-, β-, γ-synchronizers were proposed
and investigated by Awerbuch [Aw85].

EXERCISES
11.1 In a network of 100 processes, specify an initial configuration of Franklin’s algorithm
so that the leader is elected in the second round.
11.2 Consider Peterson’s algorithm for leader election on a unidirectional ring of 16 processes
0 through 15. Describe an initial configuration of the ring so that a leader is
elected in the fourth round.
11.3 Show that Chang–Roberts algorithm has an average complexity of O(n · logn).
11.4 Election is an exercise in symmetry breaking: Initially, all processes are equal, but at
the end, one process stands out as the leader. Assume that instead of a single leader,
we want to elect k leaders (k ≥ 1) on a unidirectional ring. Modify Chang–Roberts
algorithm to elect k leaders. (Do not consider the obvious solution in which first a
single leader gets elected and this leader picks (k − 1) other processes as leaders. The
goal is to explore if there is a solution to the k leader election problem that needs
fewer messages than the single leader algorithm.)
11.5 In a hypercube of n nodes, suggest an algorithm for leader election with a message
complexity of O(n · logn).
11.6 Design an election algorithm for a tree of anonymous processes. (Of course, the tree
is not a rooted tree; otherwise, the problem would have been trivial.) Think of orienting
the edges of the tree so that (1) eventually there is exactly one process (which
is the leader) with all incident edges directed toward it and (2) every leaf process has
outgoing edges only.
11.7 The problem of leader election has some similarities with the mutual exclusion
problem. Chapter 7 describes Maekawa’s distributed mutual exclusion algorithm
with O( n) message complexity. Can we use similar ideas to design a leader election
with sublinear message complexity? Explore this possibility.
11.8 In the following is the proposed design of a simple synchronizer:
a. Each process has a variable tick initialized to 0.
b. A process with tick = j exchanges messages for that tick with its neighbors.
c. When a process has sent and received all messages for the current tick, it increments
tick (the detection of safe configuration is missing from this proposal).
Clearly, a process with tick = j can receive messages for both tick = j and tick =
j + 1 from its neighbors. To satisfy the requirements of a synchronizer, the process
will buffer the messages for tick = j + 1 for later processing, until the process has
exchanged all messages for tick = j and incremented its tick.
Comment on the correctness of the simple synchronizer, and calculate its time
and message complexities.
11.9 In the ideal ABD synchronizer, the physical clocks do not drift. As a result,
after the initial synchronization, no messages are required to maintain the
synchronization.
Coordination Algorithms ◾ 245
Assume now that the physical clocks drift, so that the difference between a pair
of clocks grows up to 1 in R time units, and each process simulates a clock tick every
2δ time unit, where δ is the upper bound of the message propagation delay along
any link. Calculate the maximum time interval, after which the ABD synchronizer
will start malfunctioning.
11.10 Consider an array of processes 0, 1, 2, …, 2n − 1 that has a different type of synchrony
requirement: We will call it interleaved synchrony. Interleaved synchrony is specified
as follows: (1) neighboring processes should not execute actions simultaneously, and
(2) between two consecutive actions by any process, all its neighbors must execute an
action. When n = 4, a sample schedule is as follows:
0 2 4 6 0
1 3 5 7 0
0 2 4 6 1

and (2) a system without physical clocks.
11.11 In the following network, a synchronous distributed algorithm takes 10 rounds. The
edges are full duplex. The first round begins with each process sending a message to
its neighbors. Thereafter, in each round, every process executes the actions 〈receive
message, update a local variable, send message〉, until at the end of the last round,
every process receives the messages from its neighbors, updates its local state, and
then the computation terminates (Figure 11.7).

Fault-Tolerant Systems
12.1 INTRODUCTION
A fault is the manifestation of an unexpected behavior, and fault tolerance is a mechanism
that masks or restores the expected behavior of a system following the occurrence of faults.
Attention to fault tolerance or dependability has drastically increased over the recent years
due to our increased dependence on computers to perform critical as well as noncritical
tasks. Also, the increase in the scale of such systems indirectly contributes to the rising
number of faults. Advances in hardware engineering can make the individual components
more dependable, but it cannot eliminate them altogether. Bad system designs and behavioral
patterns like mobility can also contribute to failures.
Historically, models of failures have been linked with the level of abstraction in the
specification of a system. A VLSI designer may focus on stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults
where the outputs of certain gates are permanently stuck to either a 0 or a 1 regardless of
input variations. A system-level hardware designer, on the other hand, may be ready to
view a failure as any arbitrary or erroneous behavior of a module as a whole. A dip in the
power supply voltage or radio interferences due to lightning or a cosmic shower can cause
transient failures by perturbing the system state without causing any permanent damage
to the hardware system. Messages propagating from one process to another may be lost in
transit. Finally, even if hardware does not fail, software may fail due to code corruption,
system intrusions, improper or unexpected changes in the specifications of the system,
environmental changes, or human error.
Failures are a part of any system—the real issue is the frequency of the failures and their
consequences. The computer system ENIAC had a mean time between failures* (MTBF) of
5 min. The real interest on dependable computing started from the time of space exploration,
where the cost of a failure was unacceptably high. The widespread use of computers
in the financial world as well as in critical systems like nuclear reactors, air-traffic
* MTBF is a well-known metric for system reliability. The associated term is mean time to repair (MTTR). In any viable
system, MTTR has to be much less than MTBF.
250 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
control, avionics, or hospital patient monitoring systems where human lives are directly
affected has renewed interest in the study of fault tolerance. Despite all textbook studies,
the sources of failures are sometimes obscure or at best unforeseen, although the consequences
can be devastating. This calls for sound system design methodology and sound
engineering practices.
Before we discuss how to tolerate faults, we present a characterization of the various
kinds of faults that can occur in a system.
12.2 CLASSIFICATION OF FAULTS
Our view of a distributed system is a process-level view, so we begin with the description
of certain types of failures that are visible at the process level. Note that each type of failure
at any level may be caused by a failure at some lower level of design. Thus, a process may
cease to produce an output when a wire in the circuit breaks or a dust speck bridges two
wires on a printed circuit board. A complete characterization of the relationship between
faults at different levels is beyond the scope of our discussion. The major classes of failures
are as follows:
Crash failure: A process undergoes crash failure when it permanently ceases to execute
its actions. This is an irreversible change. There are several variations in this class. In one
variation, crash failures are treated as reversible, that is, a process may play dead for a finite
period of time, and then resume operation, or it may be repaired. Such failures are called
napping failure.
In an asynchronous model, crash failures cannot be detected with total certainty, since
there is no lower bound of the speed at which a process can execute its actions. The design
of systems tolerating crash failures would have been greatly simplified if processes could
correctly detect whether another process has crashed. In a synchronous system where
processor speeds and channel delays are bounded, crash failure can be detected using
timeout. One such implementation requires processes to periodically broadcast a heartbeat
signal that signifies I am alive. When other correct processes fail to receive the heartbeat
signal within a predefined timeout period, they conclude that the process has crashed.
In general, internal failures within a processor may not lead to a nice version of a faulty
behavior—it can sometimes be quite messy. Since most fault-tolerant algorithms are
designed to handle crash failures only, it would have been nice if any arbitrary internal
fault within a processor could be transformed to a crash failure (by incorporating extra
hardware and/or software in the processor box). This is the motivation behind the more
benign model of fail-stop processors. A fail-stop processor has two properties: (1) it halts
program execution when a failure occurs, and (2) the internal state of the volatile storage is
irretrievably lost. Schlichting and Schneider [SS83] described an implementation of a k-failstop
processor—it satisfies the fail-stop properties with high probability when k or fewer
faults occur, and the system can detect when another fail-stop processor halts. Fail-stop is a
simple abstraction meant for simplifying the design of fault-tolerant algorithms. If a system
cannot tolerate fail-stop failures, then there is no way that it can tolerate crash failures.
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 251
Omission failure: Consider a transmitter process sending a sequence of messages to a
receiver process. If the receiver does not receive one or more of the messages sent by the
transmitter, then an omission failure occurs. In real life, this can be either caused by transmitter
malfunction or due to the properties of the medium. For example, limited buffer
capacity in the routers can cause some communication systems to drop packets. In wireless
communication, messages are lost when collisions occur in the MAC layer or the receiving
node moves out of range. Techniques to deal with omission failures form a core area of
research in networking.
Transient failure: A transient failure can perturb the global state in an arbitrary way. The
agent inducing this failure may be momentarily active (like a power surge, or a mechanical
shock, or lightning), but it can make a lasting effect on the global state. In fact, omission
failures are special cases of transient failures, when the channel states are perturbed.
Empirical evidence suggests that transient faults occur frequently. Transient faults capture
the effects of environmental hazards such as gamma rays, whose duration in time is
limited. Transient failures are also caused by an overloaded power supply or due to weak
batteries. Hardware faults are not the only source of transient faults. Transient failures also
capture state corruption that occurs when software components fail. Gray [G85a] called
them Heisenbugs, a class of temporary internal faults that are intermittent in nature. They
are essentially permanent faults whose conditions of activation occur rarely or are not
easily reproducible and so difficult to detect in the testing phase. Gray and Reuter [GR93]
estimated that over 99% of bugs in IBM’s DB2 production code are supposedly nondeterministic
in nature and are thus transient.
Byzantine failure: Byzantine failures represent the weakest of all the failure models that
allow every conceivable form of erroneous behavior. As a specific example, assume that
process i multicasts the value x of a local variable to each of its neighbors. Then the following
are examples of inconsistent behaviors:
• Two distinct neighbors j and k receive values x and y, where x ≠ y.
• Every neighbor receives a value z, where z ≠ x.
• One or more neighbors do not receive any data from process i.
Some possible causes of the aforementioned kind of byzantine failures are as follows:
(1) Total or partial breakdown of a link connecting i with its neighbors. (2) Software problems
in process i. (3) Hardware synchronization problems—assume that every neighbor
is connected to the same bus, and reading the same copy of a variable x sent out by i, but
since the clocks are not perfectly synchronized, they may not read the value of x exactly at
the same time. If the value of x varies with time and the local clocks are not perfectly synchronized,
then different neighbors of i may receive different values of x from process i.
(4) Malicious actions by process i.
252 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Software failure: There are several reasons that lead to software failure:
1. Coding errors or human errors: There are documented horror stories of losing a spacecraft
because the program failed to use the appropriate units of physical parameters.
As an example, on September 23, 1999, NASA lost the $125 million Mars orbiter
spacecraft because one engineering team used metric units while another used
English units leading to a navigation fiasco, causing it to burn in the atmosphere.
2. Software design errors: Mars pathfinder mission landed flawlessly on the Martial surface
on July 4, 1997. However, later its communication failed due to a design flaw in
the real-time embedded software kernel VxWorks. The diagnosis was that the problem
occurred due to priority inversion, when a medium priority task could preempt
a high priority one.
3. Memory leaks: The execution of programs suffers from the degeneration of the runtime
system due to memory leaks, leading to a system crash. Memory leak is a phenomenon
by which processes fail to free up the entire physical memory that has been
allocated to them. This effectively reduces the size of the available physical memory
over time. When the available memory falls below the minimum required by the
system or an application, a crash becomes inevitable.
4. Problem with the inadequacy of specification: Assume that a system running program
S is producing the intended results. If the system suddenly fails to do so even if there
is no hardware failure or memory leak, then there may be a problem with specifications.
If {P} S {Q} is a theorem in programming logic, and the precondition P is inadvertently
weakened or altered, then there is no guarantee that the postcondition Q
will always hold!
A classic example of software failure is the so-called Y2K bug that rocked the world and
kept millions of service providers in an uneasy suspense for several months as the year
2000 dawned. The problem was one of inadequate specifications: When programs were
written in the twentieth century for financial institutions, power plants, or process control
systems, the year 19xy was most often coded as xy so 1999 will appear as 99. At the beginning
of the year 2000, this variable will change from 99 to 00 and the system will mistake
it for the year 1900. This could potentially upset schedules, stall operations, and trigger
unknown side effects. At least one airline grounded all of its flight on January 1, 2000, for
the fear of the unknown. Prior to January 1, 2000, millions of programmers were hired to
fix the potential problem in programs, even if in many cases the documentation was missing.
As a result, the damages were miniscule compared to the hype.
Note that many of the failures like crash, omission, transient, or byzantine can be
caused by software bugs. For example, a badly designed loop that does not terminate can
mimic a crash failure in the sender process. An inadequate policy in the router software
can cause packets to drop and trigger omission failure. And we have already observed that
Heisenbugs (permanent faults whose conditions of activation occur rarely or are not easily
reproducible) cause transient failures.
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 253
Temporal failure: Real-time systems require actions to be completed within a specific
amount of time. When this deadline is not met, a temporal failure occurs. Like software
failures, temporal failures also can lead to other types of faulty behaviors.
Security failure: Virus and other kinds of malicious software creeping into a computer
system can lead to unexpected behaviors that conform to the definition of a fault. The
effects range from allowing an intruder to eavesdrop or steal passwords to granting a complete
takeover of the computer system. Such compromised systems can exhibit arbitrary
behavior.
Some failures are repeatable, whereas others are not. Failures caused by incorrect software
are often repeatable, whereas those due to transient hardware malfunctions or due to
race conditions may not be so and therefore not detected during debugging. In the domain
of software failures, Heisenbugs are difficult to detect. Finally, human errors play a big
role in system failure. In November 1988, much of the long-distance service along the East
Coast was disrupted when a construction crew accidentally severed a major fiber optic
cable in New Jersey; as a result, 3,500,000 call attempts were blocked. On September 17,
1991, AT&T technicians in New York attending a seminar on warning systems failed to
respond to an activated alarm for 6 h. The resulting power failure blocked nearly 5 million
domestic and international calls and paralyzed air travel throughout the Northeast, causing
nearly 1170 flights to be canceled or delayed.
12.3 SPECIFICATION OF FAULTS
For the purpose of modeling fault tolerance, a system specification consists of (1) a set of
system actions S representing the fault-free (also called failure-intolerant) system and (2) a
set of fault actions F that mimic the faulty behavior. The faulty system consists of the union
of all the actions of both S and F. Readers are cautioned that this is only a simulation of the
faulty behavior and has no connection with how the fault actually occurs in the physical
system. Such simulations use auxiliary variables that are not a part of the real system. Also,
such specifications are not unique—many different specifications are possible for the same
faulty system. We present a few examples here:
Example 12.1
Assume that a system, in the absence of any fault, sends out the message “a” infinitely often
(i.e., the output is an infinite sequence a a a a...). However, a failure occasionally causes a
message to change from “a” to “b”. Such a faulty system can be specified as follows:
program faulty system 1;
define x : boolean; a b: messages
initially x = true;
S: do x → send a
F: [] true → send b
od
254 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
With a scheduler that is at least weakly fair, the difference between faulty and the
fault-free systems becomes perceptible to the outside world. For the same system,
one can model a crash failure by specifying the F-action as true → x: = false.
After F is executed, the system ceases to produce an output—a condition that
cannot be reversed using the actions of S or F.
Example 12.2
Under the broad class of byzantine failures, specific faulty behaviors can be modeled
using appropriate specifications. In the present example, the fault-free system executes
a nonterminating program by sending out an infinite sequence of integer
values
0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, .... The system failure changes the 2s to 9s.
program faulty system 2
define k: integer {value contained in a message}
x: boolean {initially x = true}
initially x = true, k = 0
S: do k<2 → send k; k: = k + 1
[] x ∧(k = 2) → k: = 0
F: [] x → x: = false
[] ¬x ∧(k = 2) → send 9; k: = 0
od
Example 12.3
Temporal failures are detected using a special predicate timeout, which becomes true
when an event does not take place within a predefined deadline. Consider a process i
broadcasting a message every 60 s to all of its neighbors. Assume that the message
propagation delay is negligibly small. If process j does not receive any message from
process i within, say, 61 s (i.e., it keeps a small allowance before passing a verdict),
a temporal failure occurs. The specification follows:
program faulty system 3
{for process i};
define T(i): timer (value in seconds}
S: do T(i) = 0 → send message to j; T(i): = 60
{Every second T(i): = T(i)−1}
F [] true→T(i): = 65
od
{for process j};
define T(j): timer (value in seconds}
S: do (T(j)>0)∧ message received from process i → T(j): = 61
{Every second T(j): = T(j)−1}
F: [] true →T(j): = 55
od
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 255
Define timeout(i, j) ≡ (T = 0)∧ no message received from process i. The predicate
timeout(i, j) will be true whenever i or j executes the F-action once, and then the normal
countdown continues. In actual practice, a temporal failure can be caused by an
increase in the propagation delay or by a loss of synchronization between the sender
and the receiver clocks.
12.4 FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS
A system that does not tolerate failures is a fault-intolerant system. In such systems, the
occurrence of a fault violates some liveness or safety property. Let P be the set of configurations
of the fault-intolerant system reachable via the specified system actions S. Given a set
of fault actions F, the fault span Q corresponds to the largest set of configurations that the
system can get into. It is a measure of how bad the system can become. The following two
conditions are trivially true:
1. P ⊆ Q.
2. Q is closed under the actions of both S and F.
It is not possible to design a system that can tolerate all kinds of failures. A system is called
F-tolerant (i.e., tolerates the fault action F) when the system maintains or returns to its
original configuration (i.e., P holds) after all F-actions stop executing. There are four major
types of fault tolerance:
1. Masking tolerance
2. Nonmasking tolerance
3. Fail-safe tolerance
4. Graceful degradation
12.4.1 Masking Tolerance
A fault f is masked if its occurrence has no impact on the application, that is, P = Q. Masking
tolerance is important in many safety-critical applications where the failure can endanger
human life or cause massive loss of property. An aircraft must be able to fly even if one
of its engines malfunctions. A patient monitoring system in a hospital must not record
patient data incorrectly even if some of the sensors or instruments malfunction, since this
can potentially cause an improper dose of medicine to be administered to the patient and
endanger his or her life. Masking tolerance preserves both liveness and safety properties of
the original system.
12.4.2 Nonmasking Tolerance
In nonmasking fault tolerance, faults may temporarily affect the application and violate
the safety property, that is, P ⊂ Q. However, liveness is not compromised, and eventually,
256 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
normal behavior is restored (Figure 12.1). Consider that while you are watching a movie,
the server crashed, but the system automatically restored the service by switching to a
standby server. The temporary glitch may be acceptable, since the failure did not have
any catastrophic consequence. As another example, consider the routing of packets from a
source to a destination node. Let a failure create a cycle in the route and trap a few packets.
However, the algorithms for routing table computation broke the cycle and the packets
eventually reached the destination. The net impact of the failure was an increase in the
message propagation delay.
There are different types of nonmasking tolerance. In backward error recovery, snapshots
of the system are periodically recorded on an incorruptible form of storage, called stable
storage. When a failure is detected, the system rolls back to the last configuration saved on
the stable storage (to undo the effect of the failure), and the computation progresses from
that point. The important issue here is to make the history of the computation right. In
forward error recovery, when a fault occurs, the system does not look back or try a rerun,
since minor glitches are considered inconsequential, as long as the normal operation is
eventually restored. Forward recovery systems that guarantee recovery from an arbitrary
initial configuration are known as self-stabilizing systems.
12.4.3 Fail-Safe Tolerance
Certain faulty configurations do not affect the application in an adverse way and are therefore
considered harmless. A fail-safe system relaxes the tolerance requirement by only
avoiding those faulty configurations that may have catastrophic consequences, even when
failures occur. For example, if at a four-way traffic crossing, the lights are green in both
directions, then a collision is possible. However, if the lights are red in both directions,
then at best traffic will stall, but will not have any catastrophic side effect.
Given a safety specification P, a fail-safe system preserves P despite the occurrence of
failures. However, there is no guarantee that liveness will be preserved. Sometimes, halting
progress and leaving the system in a safe state may be the best possible way to cope
with failures. The ground control system of the Ariane 5 launcher was designed to mask
all single faults, but when two successive component failures occur, it would postpone the
launch (this is safer than a mishap in the space).
Fault occurs here Fault occurs here
Recovery completes here Recovery completes here
FIGURE 12.1 An illustration of fault recovery.
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 257
12.4.4 Graceful Degradation
There are systems that neither mask nor fully recover from the effect of failures. Such systems
exhibit a degraded behavior that falls short of the normal behavior, but are still considered
acceptable. The notion of acceptability is highly subjective and is entirely dependent
on the user running the application. Some examples of degraded behavior are as follows:
1. Consider a taxi booth where customers call to order a taxi. Under normal conditions,
(i) each customer ordering a taxi must eventually get it, and (ii) these requests must
be serviced in the order in which they are received at the booth. In case of a failure, a
degraded behavior that satisfies only condition (i) but not (ii) may be acceptable.
2. While routing a message between two points in a network, a program computes the
shortest path. In the presence of a failure, if this program returns another path that
is not the shortest path but one that is marginally longer than the shortest one, then
this may be considered acceptable.
3. A pop machine returns a can of soda when a customer inserts 75 cents in quarters,
dimes, or nickels. After a failure, if the machine refuses to accept dimes and nickels,
but returns a can of soda only if the customer deposits three quarters, then it may be
considered acceptable.
4. An operating system switches to a safe mode when users cannot create or modify
files, but can only read the files that already exist.
12.4.5 Detection of Failures in Synchronous Systems
The implementation of fault tolerance becomes easier if there exists some mechanism for
detecting failures. This in turn depends on specific assumptions about the degree of synchronization:
like the existence of synchronized clocks, or the lower bound on the processor
speed, or upper bound on message propagation delays, as described in Chapter 4.
Consider, for example, a crash failure. Without any assumption about the lower bound of
process execution speeds and the upper bound of message propagation delays, it is impossible
to detect a crash failure, because it is not feasible to distinguish between a crashed
process and a nonfaulty process that is executing actions very slowly. When these bounds
are known, timeout can be used to detect crash failures.
As another example, consider how omission failures can be detected. The problem is as
hard as the detection of crash failures, unless the channels are FIFO or an upper bound of the
message propagation delay δ is known. With a FIFO channel that is initially empty, a sender
process i tags every message m with a sequence number seq as described in the following:
do true → send 〈m[seq],seq〉; seq: = seq + 1 od
If a receiver process receives two consecutive messages whose sequence numbers are i and j,
and j ≠ i + 1, then an omission failure is detected. With non-FIFO channels, if a message
258 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
with sequence number i is received, but the previous message does not arrive within δ time
units, then the receiver detects an omission failure.
Compared to crash failures, byzantine failures are much harder to deal with. In synchronous
distributed systems where an upper bound on the message propagation delays or
lower bound on processor speeds exists, some forms of byzantine failures can be detected.
These are based on the various consensus protocols available in the published literature for
tolerating byzantine failures. For asynchronous distributed systems, failure detectors and
their use in solving consensus problems have received substantial attention. We postpone
further discussions on failure detectors to Chapter 13.
The design of a fault-tolerant system requires knowledge about the application and its
expected behavior, the fault scenario, and the type of tolerance desired. In the following
sections, we will discuss the implementation of fault tolerance for crash and omission failures,
and examine their complexities. Byzantine agreement and self-stabilizing systems
will be presented in Chapters 13 and 17, respectively.
12.5 TOLERATING CRASH FAILURES
A simple and age-old technique of tolerating crash failures is to replicate the process or
functional modules, with the idea that the functioning modules will make up for the nonfunctional
ones. Double modular redundancy (DMR) can mask a single crash, and TMR
can mask any single fault. The ideas are explained in the following text:
12.5.1 Double and Triple Modular Redundancy
Consider a process B that receives an input value x, computes the function y = f(x), and
sends it to process C. If B crashes, then C does not receive the value of y. To mask the effect
of B’s crash, replace process B by a pair of replicas B0 and B1 (Figure 12.2a)—such a system
can tolerate a single crash. With n such replicas (n > 1) of B, it is possible to tolerate the
crash of m replicas, where m ≤ n − 1.
Extending this idea, if there are three replicas of B (Figure 12.2b) and any one of them
malfunctions (this includes not only crash but also arbitrary failures), then process C will

type: V is the voting unit.
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 259
receive the correct value of y = f(x) since the majority voting unit V will vote out the bad
value. This is the basic idea of TMR. A generalization of this approach is n-modular redundancy
that masks m arbitrary failures, where n ≥ 2m + 1.
Can the unit that computes the majority vote also fail? Yes. However, the voting
unit is considered to be a logical part of C. If C fails, then the result of the vote does
not matter.
12.6 TOLERATING OMISSION FAILURES
Assume that a sender process S sends out a sequence of messages m[0], m[1], m[2], … to
a receiver process R (Figure 12.3). If the upper bound of the message propagation delay
is not known and the channels are not FIFO, then the receiver must send acknowledgments
to the sender to notify the arrival of a message. To detect the nonarrival of a message,
process S can at best make a good guess of the round-trip propagation delay and
set a timer accordingly. If there is a timeout, the sender retransmits the message. Due
to the transient nature of the failure, it is assumed that if a message is sent a bounded
number of times, then it will eventually reach the receiver and will be delivered to the
application at the receiving end. In case the sender’s guess about the round-trip delay is
incorrect and the timeout is too early, retransmissions may lead to duplicate messages
on the channel. In this context, a reliable channel from S to R should meet the following
three requirements:
1. No loss: The receiver eventually delivers each message sent out by the sender.
2. No duplication: The receiver delivers each message sent by the sender exactly once.
3. No reordering: The receiver always delivers the message m[i] before m[i + 1].
Thus, if S sends out the sequence a b c d e, then the first condition rules out R accepting this
sequence as a c d e, the second condition rules out the possibility of R accepting it as a b b
c c c d e, and the third condition prevents R from accepting it as a c e b d.

260 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
12.6.1 Stenning’s Protocol
Stenning’s protocol provides an implementation of a reliable channel. The receiving process R,
after receiving each message m[i], sends an acknowledgment back to S and decides whether
to deliver it to the upper layer. However, not only messages but also acknowledgments can
disappear, making the game a bit tricky. Here is a description of Stenning’s protocol:
program Stenning’s protocol;
{program for the sender S}
define ok : boolean, next, j : integer
m: array[0..∞] of messages, ack: acknowledgment
initially next = 0, ok = true, and both channels (S,R) and (R,S) are empty
do ok → send (m[next],next); ok: = false
[] (ack, j) received → if (j = next)→ ok: = true; next: = next + 1

Stenning’s protocol implements a reliable channel.
Proof: (No loss) If R does not receive m[i], then it does not send (ack, i), which triggers a
retransmission of m[i]. After a bounded number of retransmissions, one copy of m[i] must
be received and delivered by R.
(No duplication and no reordering) Once R delivers m[i], it increments r to (i + 1). Note
that R does not deliver the received message unless its sequence number matches r, so
duplicate messages are rejected. For the same reason, R always delivers the message m[i]
before m[i + 1]. Therefore, the no reordering criterion holds.
Finally, we demonstrate that the progress property is satisfied. Assume that S sent m[i],
it was received by R, and R sent (ack, i), but the ack was lost in transit. So S resent m[i]. But
in the meantime, R increased the value of r to (i + 1) and was expecting to receive m[i + 1],
so it would reject the duplicate copy of m[i]. By sending a replica of (ack, i), R guarantees
that eventually S receives it and then sends m[i + 1]. This guarantees
progress. ◾
Stenning’s protocol is also commonly known as the stop-and-wait protocol. It is inefficient,
since even in the best case, the sender has to wait for one round-trip delay to send

each message, leading to a low throughput. In real life, different variations of this basic idea
are used. One such variation is the sliding window protocol.
12.6.2 Sliding Window Protocol
The sliding window protocol is a widely used transport layer protocol for implementing a
reliable channel between a pair of processes. It is a generalization of Stenning’s protocol
and uses the same mechanism to deal with the loss or reordering of messages. In addition,
the sliding window protocol has provisions to improve the transmission rate and restore
the message order at the receiving end without overflowing its buffer space. The primary
feature is as follows: The sender continues the send action without receiving the acknowledgments
of at most w (w > 0) outstanding messages, where w is called the window size. If
no acknowledgment to the previous w messages is received within the timeout period, then
the sender resends those w messages (Figure 12.4).

Theorem 12.2
Program sliding window implements a reliable channel.
Proof (by induction): Basis: R eventually receives and delivers m[0]. This is because, if R
does not receive m[0], then it does not send any acknowledgment, which triggers a timeout
at S followed by a retransmission of m[0]. In a bounded number of transmissions, R
receives and delivers m[0]. Using the arguments in the proof of Stenning’s protocol, it is
easy to establish that m[0] is delivered exactly once.
Induction hypothesis: Assume that R has delivered every message m[0] through m[k] (k > 0)
exactly once and in the ascending order. S now sends m[k + 1] since the condition last < k +
1 ≤ last + w holds. We need to show that eventually R accepts m[k + 1].
Induction step: If m[k + 1] is lost in transit, then no guard of R is not enabled. When the
remaining messages in the current window are sent by S, the acknowledgment (ack, k)
returned by R does not cause S to increment the value of last beyond k. Eventually, timeout
is enabled for process S, and it retransmits messages m[last + 1] through m[last + w]—this
includes m[k + 1]. In a finite number of rounds of retransmission, m[k + 1] is received and
delivered by R. Since the condition r = k + 1 is asserted exactly once, the message m[k + 1]
will be accepted exactly once. ◾
A concern here is that the sliding window protocol uses unbounded sequence numbers.
This raises the question: Is it possible to implement a window protocol using bounded
sequence numbers, such that it withstands the loss, duplication, and reordering of messages?
The answer is no. To understand why, consider the informal argument: To withstand
loss (which cannot be distinguished from indefinitely large propagation delay), messages
have to be retransmitted, so for every message (m[],k) sent by the sender, there may be a
duplicate (call it (m′[], k) in the channel. Also, if the sequence numbers are bounded, then
they will be recycled, so at some point in the future, there will be another new message
(m″[], k) sent after (m[], k) and it bears the same sequence number k.
Suppose that m, m′, and m″ are in the channel. Since the channel is not FIFO, these
messages can arrive in any order. If the receiver receives and delivers m, then it should not
deliver m′ to avoid duplicate reception of the same message, but then it will also not deliver
the new message m″ since m′ and m″ have the same sequence numbers, and they are indistinguishable!
Using bounded sequence numbers, there is no way to institute a mechanism
by which m″ is delivered but m′ is rejected. This leads to the following theorem:
Theorem 12.3
If the communication channels are non-FIFO, and the message propagation delays are
arbitrarily large, then using bounded sequence numbers, it is impossible to design a window
protocol that can withstand the loss, duplication, and reordering of messages.
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 263
Several variations of the sliding window protocol are used in practice. One common
variation if for the receiver to maintain a window that defines the range of message sequence
numbers (instead of a single number) that the receiver is ready to accept. The messages
received within this window are buffered until they can be delivered. In the selective repeat
version, when the sender notices the absence of an acknowledgment for one or more messages
during a timeout, it selectively transmits only the missing messages. This conserves
bandwidth at the expense of buffer space.
12.6.3 Alternating Bit Protocol
The alternating bit protocol is a special version of the sliding window protocol, for which
w = 1. It works only when the links are FIFO, which rules out message reordering. It is a
suitable candidate for use in the data-link layer.
The unbounded sequence number was a major hurdle in implementing the sliding window
protocols on non-FIFO channels. With FIFO channels, the alternating bit protocol
overcomes this problem by appending only a 1-bit sequence number to the body of the
message. The protocol is described as follows:
program ABP;
{program for the sender S}
define sent, b, j ∈ {0, 1}, next : integer;
initially next = 0, sent = 1, b = 0, and channels (S,R) and (R,S) are empty;
do sent ≠ b → send (m[next], b); next: = next+1; sent: = b
[] (ack,j) received ∧ (j = b) → b: = 1 − b
[] timeout(R,S) → send (m[next − 1], b)
od
{program for the receiver R}
define s,r ∈{0, 1}
initially r = 0;
do (m[],s) received ∧ (s = r) → deliver m[]; send (ack,r); r: = 1 − r
[] (m[],s) received ∧ (s ≠ r)→ send (ack, 1 − r)
od
Without going through a formal proof, we demonstrate why the FIFO property of the
channel is considered essential for the alternating bit protocol.
Consider the global state of Figure 12.5 reached in the following way: m[0] was transmitted
by S and accepted by R, but its acknowledgment (ack, 0) was delayed—so S transmitted m[0]
once more. When (ack, 0) finally reached S, it sent out m[1]. In general, the state of channel
(S, R) is a concatenation of zero or more (m[i], b), followed by zero or more (m[i + 1], (1 − b)).
If the channels are not FIFO, then (m[1], 1) may reach R before the duplicate copy of
(m[0], 0) reaches R. R will accept it and send it back (ack, 1) to S. On receipt of this (ack, 1),
S will send out (m[2], 0). When the duplicate copy of (m[0], 0) reaches R, and R accepts it, as
it mistakes it for m[2] since both m[0] and m[2] have the same sequence number 0! Clearly,
264 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
this possibility is ruled out when the channels are FIFO—the receiver R is certain that the
received packet contains m[2] and not a duplicate copy of m[0].
12.6.4 How TCP Works
TCP is the most widely used connection management protocol used on the Internet. It
supports the end-to-end logical connection between two processes running on any two
computers on the same network or on different networks. It uses the main idea of sliding
windows and handles a wide variety of channel failures or perturbations that include the
loss and reordering of packets. The link is created by a connection establishment phase and
terminated by a connection-closing phase.
A key issue is the ability to generate unique sequence numbers for packets. A sequence
number is safe to use if it is not identical to one of the sequence numbers that is currently in
use. There are various approaches for generating unique sequence numbers. Some of these
do not provide absolute guarantees, but sequence numbers are unique with a high probability.
For example, if the sequence number is a randomly chosen 64-bit pattern, then it
is highly unlikely that the same sequence number will be used again during the lifetime of
the application. The guarantee can be further consolidated if the system knows the upper
bound (δ) of the message propagation delay across the channel. Every sequence number is
automatically flushed out of the system after an interval 2δ from the time it was generated.
It is even more unlikely for two identical random 32-bit or 64-bit sequence numbers to be
generated within a time 2δ.
TCP uses a connection establishment phase outlined in Figure 12.6. The sender S sends
a synchronization message (SYN, seq = x) to request a connection, x being the sequence
number proposed by S. The receiver returns its acceptance by proposing a new sequence
number seq = y (the sender can verify its uniqueness by checking it against a pool of used
ids in the past 2δ time period; otherwise, a cleanup is initiated) and appending it to x, so
that the sender can recognize that it was a response to its recent request. The (ack = x + 1)
message is a routine response reflecting the acceptance of the connection request with
a sequence number x. If the receiver responds with (seq = y, ack = z) and z ≠ x + 1, then
the sender recognizes it as a bad message, ignores it, and waits for the correct message.
To complete the connection establishment, the sender sends an (ack, y + 1) back to the

Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 265
receiver, indicating that it accepted the proposed sequence number y. This is called a threeway
handshake. The sender starts sending data using the starting sequence number x + 1.
To close a TCP connection, the initiator sends a FIN packet. The connection closes only
when an ack has been sent by R and received by the S.
The initial 32-bit sequence numbers x and y are randomly chosen integers. When a
machine crashes and reboots, a randomly chosen 32-bit sequence number is most likely to
be different from any sequence number used in the recent past. In case a request packet or
an accept packet is lost, the packet is retransmitted after a timeout period.
A knowledge of δ (obtained by monitoring the round-trip delay) helps choose an appropriate
value of timeout. If the timeout period is too small, then unnecessary retransmissions
will drastically increase the congestion, whereas a large timeout period will unduly
slow down the throughput. The choice is made using adaptive retransmission. TCP also
allows flow control by permitting the receiver to throttle the sender and control the window
size depending on the amount of buffer space it has to store the unprocessed data. For
details on flow control, read a standard textbook on networking like [PD96].
12.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The specification of faulty behavior using auxiliary variables and fault actions only mimic
the faulty behavior and has no connection with the physical cause of the failure. Adding
additional actions to overcome the effect of a failure mostly works at the model level—only
in limited cases, they can be translated into the design of a fault-tolerant system.
There are several different views regarding the taxonomy of failures. For example,
omission failures may not always result in the loss of a message, but may include the
(SYN,seq = x)
ack = y +1
SYN,seq = y, ack = x+1

skipping of one or more steps by a process, which leads to an arbitrary pattern of behavior
that fits the byzantine failure class.
No fault-tolerant system can be designed without some form of redundancy. The
redundancy can be in hardware (like spare or standby units), or in the amount of space
used per process, or in the time taken by the application. The type of fault tolerance to
be used largely depends on the application and its users. It is quite possible that different
types of tolerances are desirable against different kinds of faults. As an example,
one may expect a system to exhibit masking tolerance against all single faults, but
accept a stabilizing behavior when multiple faults occur, since the cost of implementing
masking tolerance for multiple faults may be too high. This is known as multitolerance.
Stabilization and checkpointing represent two opposing kinds of scenario in nonmasking
tolerance. Checkpointing relies on history and recovery leads to an auditable history
of the computation. Stabilization, on the other hand, is history-insensitive and does not
worry about behavioral errors as long as eventual recovery is guaranteed.
Finally, security breach can lead to different kinds of failures. While many failures are
caused due to dust, humidity, cobwebs on the printed circuit boards, or spilled coffee on
the keyboard, a security loophole that allows a virus can force the system to shut down
services or make the system behave in a bizarre way. However, so far, the fault-tolerance
community and the security community have maintained separate identities with minimal
overlap between them.
12.8 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Ezhilchelvan and Srivastava [ES86] presented a taxonomy of failures that closely resembles
the taxonomy presented in this chapter. Rushby [R94] wrote an exhaustive and thoughtful
article on faults and related terminologies. Gray’s article [G85a] examined many intricate
aspects of why computers stop working, and discussed about Heisenbugs and Bohrbugs
(unlike Heisenbugs, these are solid bugs that can be consistently reproduced during the
testing phase). The general method of fault specification has been adapted from Arora and
Gouda’s work [AG93]. TMR and n-modular redundancy have been in use from the days of
World War II to current applications in aircraft control and website mirroring—the original
idea is due to von Neumann [VN56]. Lampson [LPS81] introduced stable storage for
implementing atomic transactions. Sliding window protocols and their use in the design
of TCP and other end-to-end protocols can be found in every textbook on networking—
see, for example, Peterson and Davie’s book [PD96]. The alternating bit protocol was first
introduced as a mechanism of supporting full-duplex communication on half-duplex
channels—the earliest work is due to Lynch [Ly68].
Herlihy and Wing [HW91] presented a formal specification of graceful degradation. The
work on multitolerance is due to Arora and Kulkarni [AK98]. Dega [De96] reported how
fault tolerance was built into the design of Ariane 5 rocket launcher. Unfortunately, despite
such a design, the project failed. On June 4, 1996, only 40 s after the launch, the launcher
veered off its path and exploded—which was later attributed to software failure. Gärtner
[G99] wrote a survey on the design of fault-tolerant systems.

EXERCISES
12.1 A sender P sends a sequence of messages to a receiver Q. In the absence of any failure,
the communication from P to Q is FIFO—however, due to failure, the messages
can reach Q out of order. Give a formal specification of this failure using normal and
fault actions.
12.2 Buffer overflows (also known as pointer or heap or stack smashing) are a well-known
source of program failure. What kind of fault models would capture their effects on
the rest of the system?
12.3 Consider the following real-life failure scenarios and examine if these can be
mapped to any of the known fault classes introduced in this chapter:
a. On January 15, 1990, 114 switching nodes of the long-distance system of AT&T
went down. A bug in the failure recovery code of the switches was responsible
for this. Ordinarily, when a node crashed, it sent out-of-service message to
the neighboring nodes, prompting the neighbors to reroute traffic around it.
However, the bug (a misplaced break statement in C code) caused the neighboring
nodes to crash themselves upon receiving the out-of-service message. This
further propagated the fault by sending an out-of-service message to nodes further
out in the network. The crash affected the service of an estimated 60,000
people for 9 h, causing AT&T to lose $60 million revenue.
b. A program module of the Arianne space shuttle received a numerical value that
it was not equipped to handle. The resulting variable overflow caused the shuttle’s
onboard computer to fail. The rocket went out of control and subsequently crashed.
12.4 No fault-tolerant system can be implemented without some form of redundancy.
The redundancy could be in spare hardware or extra space or extra time or extra
messages used in the implementation. In this context, revisit the sliding window
protocol and identify the redundancies.
12.5 Consider the following specification of a faulty process:
program what-fault
define : x: integer {initially x = 1}
do x = 0→x: = 1; send “hello” {S-actions}
[] x = 1→x: = 2 {S-action}
[] x = 2→x: = 0 {S-action}
[] x = 1→x: = 3 {F-action}
od
What kind of fault does the F-action induce?
12.6 The fault-tolerance community sometimes uses a term: repair fault. How will you justify
repair as a failure so that it can trigger unexpected behavior? Present an example.
12.7 Failures are not always independent—the effect of one type of failure can sometimes
be manifested as another kind of failure. Create two different scenarios to illustrate
how temporal failures (i.e., a missed deadline) can lead to (1) crash failures and (2)
omission failures.
268 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
12.8 Explain how software errors can lead to (1) omission failure and (2) byzantine failure
in a process. Provide examples to explain the complete scenario in each case.
12.9 A sender P sends a sequence of messages to a receiver Q. Each message m is tagged
with a unique sequence number seq that increases monotonically, so the program
for P can be specified as follows:
program sender
define seq : integer {message sequence number}
initially seq = 0
do true→send(m[seq],seq); seq: = seq + 1 od
The messages may reach Q out of order, but they are never lost. To accept messages in
strictly increasing order of sequence numbers, Q uses a sequencer that resequences
the message delivery:
a. Describe the program for the sequencer. Calculate its buffer requirement.
b. Now, assume that the sequencer has the ability to hold at most two messages in
its buffer. Rewrite the programs of P and the sequencer, so that Q receives the
messages in strictly increasing order of sequence numbers.
12.10 Communication links are generally reliable, and omission failures are generally
rare. To conserve bandwidth, sometimes acks are replaced by nack (negative
acknowledgment), where the receiver only sends a nack to inform the sender that
it did not receive an expected message. If no nack is received, the sender is happy,
assuming that the receiver has received its messages. Rewrite Stenning’s protocol
using nack.
12.11 Consider a soda machine that dispenses a can of soda to a customer who deposits
50 cents using some combination of quarters, dimes, and nickels. The program is
as follows:
program soda machine
define credit : integer {initially credit = 0)
do quarter deposited → credit: = credit+25
[] dime deposited → credit: = credit+10
[] nickel deposited → credit: = credit+5
[] credit≥50 → dispense a can of soda; credit: = 0
od
a. The following fault action F ≡ credit = 45 → credit: = 0 triggered a malfunction
of the soda machine. Describe the nature of the malfunction. What notice will
you post on the machine to alert the customers until the problem is fixed?
b. Modify the program for the soda machine so that it tolerates the specific failure
and customers are not affected at all.
Fault-Tolerant Systems ◾ 269
12.12 The alternating bit protocol described earlier is designed for a window size 1. This
leads to a poor throughput. To improve the throughput, generalize the protocol to a
window size w > 1 and calculate the lower bound of the size of the sequence number.
12.13 A system of n processes can mask up to m arbitrary failures using majority voting
when n ≥ 2m + 1. Consider downgrading the tolerance from masking to fail-safe
and assume that no output is safe. Can the system now tolerate the crash of a larger
number of processes? Explain your answer.

Chapter 13
Distributed Consensus
13.1 INTRODUCTION
Consensus problems have widespread applications in distributed computing. Before introducing
the formal definitions or discussing possible solutions, we first present a few motivating
examples of consensus, some of which have been visited in Chapters 7 and 13:
Example 13.1
A number of processes in a network decide to elect a leader. Each process begins with
a bid for leadership. At the end, one of these processes is elected the leader, and it
reflects the final decision of every process.
Example 13.2
Alice wants to transfer a sum of $1000 from her savings account in Las Vegas to a
checking account in Iowa City. There are two components of this transaction: debit
$1000 and credit $1000. Two distinct servers handle the two components. Regardless
of failures, a transaction must be atomic—it will be a disaster if the debit operation is
completed but the credit operation fails, or vice versa. Accordingly, two different servers
have to reach an agreement about whether to commit or to abort the transaction.
Example 13.3
Five independent sensors measure the temperature T of a furnace. Each sensor
checks if T is greater than 1000°C. Some sensors may be faulty, but it is not known
which are faulty. The nonfaulty sensors have to agree about the truth of the predicate
T > 1000°C (so that the next course of action can be decided).
272 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Example 13.4
Consider the problem of synchronizing a set of phase clocks that are ticking at the
same rate in different geographical locations of a network. Viewed as a consensus
problem, the initial values (of phases) are the set of local readings (which can be arbitrary),
but the final phases must be identical.
Consensus problems are far less interesting in the absence of failures. This chapter studies
distributed consensus in the presence of failures. The problem can be formulated as follows:
a distributed system contains n processes {0, 1, 2, …, n−1}. Every process has an initial
value in a mutually agreed domain. The problem is to devise an algorithm such that despite
the occurrence of failures, processes eventually agree upon an irrevocable final decision
value that satisfies the following three conditions:
Termination: Every nonfaulty process must eventually decide.
Agreement: The final decision of every nonfaulty process must be identical.
Validity: If every nonfaulty process begins with the same initial value v, then their final
decision must be v.
The validity criterion adds a dose of sanity check—it is silly to reach agreement when the
agreed value reflects nobody’s initial choice. Also, the irrevocability of the final decision
is important: If a stock broker gets confirmation from his or her system that Alice bought
50 shares of Wind Energy Inc. online, then even if the broker’s computer is destroyed by a
tsunami, Alice should be able to go to any other broker and sell those shares.
All of the previous examples illustrate exact agreement. In some cases, approximate
agreement is considered adequate. For example, physical clock synchronization
always allows the difference between two clock readings to be less than a small
skew—exact agreement is not achievable. The agreement and validity criteria do not
specify whether the final decision value has to be chosen by a majority vote—the lower
threshold of acceptance is defined by the validity rule. Individual applications may
fine-tune their agreement goals within the broad scopes of the three specifications. In
Example 13.2, if the server in Iowa City decides to commit the action but the server in
Las Vegas decides to abort since Alice’s account balance is less than $1000, then the
consensus should be an abort instead of commit—this satisfies both termination and
validity. Validity does not follow from agreement. Leaving validity out may lead to the
awkward possibility that even if both servers prefer to abort the transaction, the final
decision may be a commit.
In this chapter, we will address various problems related to reaching an agreement about
a value or an action in a distributed system. We will separately discuss consensus in asynchronous
and synchronous systems.
Distributed Consensus ◾ 273
13.2 CONSENSUS IN ASYNCHRONOUS SYSTEMS
Seven members of a busy household decided to hire a cook, since they do not have time
to prepare their own food. Each member of the household separately interviewed every
applicant for the cook’s position. Depending on how it went, each member formed his
or her independent opinion yes (means hire) or no (means don’t hire). These members
will now have to communicate with one another to reach a uniform final decision about
whether the applicant will be hired. The process will be repeated with each applicant,
until someone is hired.
Consider an instance of this hiring process that deals with a single candidate. The members
may communicate their decisions in arbitrary ways. Since they do not meet each other
very often, they may decide to communicate by phone, or through letters, or by posting a
note on a common bulletin board in the house. The communication is completely asynchronous,
so actions by the individual members may take an arbitrary but finite amount
of time to complete. Also, no specific assumption is made about how the final decision is
reached, except that the final decision is irrevocable (so you cannot decide to hire the candidate
and later say sorry). Is there a guarantee that the members will eventually reach a
consensus about whether to hire the candidate?
If there is no failure, then reaching an agreement is trivial. Each member sends his or
her initial opinion to every other member. Define V to be the bag of initial opinions by all
the members of the household. Due to the absence of failure, every member is guaranteed
to receive an identical bag V of opinions from all the members. To reach a common final
decision, every member will apply the same choice function f on this bag of opinions.
Reaching consensus, however, becomes surprisingly difficult, when one or more members
fail to execute actions. Assume that at most, k members (k > 0) can undergo crash
failure. An important result due to Fischer et al. [FLP85] states that in a fully asynchronous
system, it is impossible to reach consensus even if k = 1.* The consensus requires agreement
among nonfaulty members only—we do not care about the faulty members.
For an abstract formulation of this impossibility result, treat every member as a process.
The network of processes is completely connected. Assume that the initial opinion or the
final decision by a process is an element of the set {0, 1} where 0 ≡ don’t hire, 1 ≡ hire. We
demonstrate the impossibility result for the shared-memory model only, where processes
communicate with one another using read and write actions. The results hold for the
message-passing model too, but we will skip the proof for that model.
13.2.1 Bivalent and Univalent States
The progress of a consensus algorithm can be abstracted using a binary decision state.
The two possible decision states are bivalent and univalent. A decision state is bivalent if
starting from that state, there exist at least two distinct executions leading to two distinct
* Remember that crash failures cannot be reliably detected in asynchronous systems. It is not possible to distinguish
between a processor that has crashed and a processor that is executing its actions very slowly.
274 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
decision values 0 or 1. What it means is that from a bivalent state, there is a potential for
reaching any one of the two possible decision values. A state from which only one decision
value can be reached is called a univalent state. Univalent states can be either 0-valent or
1-valent. In a 0-valent state, the system is committed to the irrevocable final decision 0.
Similarly, in a 1-valent state, the system is committed to the irrevocable final decision 1.
As an illustration, consider a best-of-five-sets tennis match between two players A
and B. If the score is 6-3, 6-4 in favor of A, then the decision state is bivalent, since anyone
could win. If, however, the score becomes 6-3, 6-4, 6-1 in favor of A, then the state
becomes univalent, since even if the game continues till the fifth set, only A can win. At
this point, the outcome of the remaining two sets becomes irrelevant. This trivially leads
to the following lemma.
Lemma 13.1
No execution leads from a 0-valent to a 1-valent state or vice versa.
Lemma 13.2
Every consensus protocol must have a bivalent initial state.
Proof (by contradiction): An initial state consists of a vector of n binary values—each
value is the initial choice of a process. Assume that no initial state is bivalent. Now, consider
an array s[0 .. n − 1] of n carefully chosen initial states as shown in Table 13.1. Note that the
vectors in the successive rows differ by one bit only. Per the validity criterion of consensus,
s[0] is 0-valent, and s[n − 1] is 1-valent. In the above array, there must exist states s[n − i − 1]
and s[n − i] such that (1) s[n − i − 1] is 0-valent, (2) s[n − i] is 1-valent, and (3) the vectors
differ in the value chosen by some process i. Now consider a computation e (not involving
process i—thus, e mimics the crash of i) that starts from s[n − i − 1] and leads to the final
decision 0. The same computation e must also be a valid computation starting from s[n − i],
which is 1-valent. This contradicts Lemma 13.1. Therefore, no consensus protocol should
have a univalent initial state.

Lemma 13.3
In a consensus protocol, starting from any initial bivalent state I, there must exist a reachable
bivalent state T, from where every action taken by some process p leads to either a
0-valent or a 1-valent state.
Proof: If every state reachable from I is bivalent, then no decision is reached—this violates
the termination criteria of the consensus protocol. In order that decisions are reached,
every execution must eventually lead to some univalent state.
Assume that there is a bivalent state T reachable from I (Figure 13.1)—from T action 0 by
process p leads to the 0-valent state T0, and action 1 by process q ≠ p leads to the 1-valent
state T1. This implies that the guards of both p and q are enabled in state T. We will first
argue that p and q cannot be distinct processes. Assume a shared-memory model* and
consider three cases:
Case 1: At least one of the actions (action 0 or action 1) is a read action.
Without loss of generality, let action 0 by p be a read operation and action 1 by q be a write
operation. The read action does not have any impact on any other process in the system, so
the write action by process q in state T remains a feasible action in state T0 also. Consider
now a computation e1 from state T (Figure 13.2a) where q executes action 1 followed by a
suffix that excludes any step by process p (which mimics the crash of p). Such a computation
must exist if consensus is possible when a process crashes. Let e1 lead to decision 1.
Now, consider another computation e0 that starts with action 0 by p. To every process r ≠ p,
the states T0 and T are indistinguishable. So one can use e1 as the suffix of the computation
e0 from state T0 onwards. The final decision now is 0. To every process other than p,
the two computations e0 and e1 are indistinguishable, but the final decisions are different.
This is not possible. Therefore, p = q.
* Similar arguments can be made for the message-passing model also. See [FLP85] for details.

276 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Case 2: Both action 0 and action 1 are write operations, but on different variables.
In this case, the two writes are noninterfering, that is, no write by one process negates
the effect of write by the other process. Now, consider two computations e0 and e1 from
state T: In e0, p executes action 0, q executes action 1, and then the remaining actions lead
to the final decision 0. In e1, the first two actions are swapped, that is, the first action is
by q and the second action is by p, and the remaining actions lead to the final decision 1
(see Figure 13.2b). However, in both cases, after the first two steps, the same global state is
reached, so the final outcomes cannot be different! Therefore, p = q.
Case 3: Both action 0 and action 1 are write operations, but on the same variable.
If p, q execute actions 0 and 1 one after another, then the second action will overwrite the
result of the first action. Consider two computations e0 and e1 from state T: In e1, q executes
action 1 followed by a suffix that excludes any step by process p (which mimics the crash
of p), and it leads to decision 1. In e0, use e1 as the suffix of the computation after action 0
(i.e., p writes). Observe that in e0, after q writes following p’s write, the state is the same as T1.
To every process other than p, the two computations e0 and e1 are indistinguishable, but e0
leads to a final decision 0, whereas e1 leads to decision 1. This is impossible. Therefore, p = q.
Process p is called a decider process for the bivalent state T.
Theorem 13.1
In asynchronous distributed systems, it is impossible to design a consensus protocol that
will tolerate the crash failure of a single process.
Proof: Let T be a bivalent decision state reachable from the initial state and p be a decider
process, such that action 0 by process p leads to the decision 0, and action 1 by process p leads
to the decision 1. What if p crashes in state T, that is, beginning from state T, process p does not
execute any further action? Due to actions taken by the remaining processes, the system can
possibly move to another bivalent state U. Since the computation must terminate, that is, the
system will eventually reach consensus, bivalent states cannot form a cycle. This implies there
must exist a reachable bivalent state R, in which (1) no action leads to another bivalent state,
and (2) each enabled process r is a decider. If r crashes, then no consensus is reached.

Distributed Consensus ◾ 277
This explains why the family members may never reach a consensus about hiring a cook as
long as one of them postpones his or her decision indefinitely or does not respond (equivalent
to a crash). For a more rigorous proof of this result, see [Ly96]. Note that the impossibility
result holds only for deterministic solutions—there are probabilistic solutions for
reaching consensus in the presence of crash failures [B83].
13.3 CONSENSUS IN SYNCHRONOUS SYSTEMS:
BYZANTINE GENERALS PROBLEM
The byzantine generals problem deals with reaching consensus in the presence of byzantine
failures. Byzantine failure model (Chapter 12) captures any arbitrary form of erratic behavior:
a faulty process may send arbitrary messages, or undergo arbitrary state transitions
not consistent with its specification, or decide not to execute any action. Even malicious
behavior is not ruled out. A solution to the consensus problem in the presence of byzantine
failures should be applicable to systems where no guarantees about process behaviors are
available. Purely asynchronous models are so weak that it is impossible to solve the consensus
problem even for simple failures like crash. In Lamport et al. [LSP82], a solution
for synchronous distributed systems using the message-passing model was proposed. This
section presents the solution in [LSP82]. The story line is as follows:
In a particular phase of a war, n generals 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1 try to reach an agreement about
whether to attack or to retreat. Each general may have his own preference about whether to
attack or to retreat. However, a sensible goal in warfare is that all generals agree upon the
same plan of action. The generals will do so by exchanging their individual preferences.
However, some of these generals may be traitors—their goal is to prevent the loyal generals
from reaching an agreement. For this, a traitor may indefinitely postpone their participation
or send conflicting messages. No one knows who the traitors are. The problem is
to devise a strategy, by which every loyal general eventually agrees upon the same plan,
regardless of the action of the traitors.
We assume that the system is synchronous: computation speeds have a known lower
bound and channel delays have a known upper bound so that the absence of messages can
be detected using timeout.
13.3.1 Solution with No Traitor
In the absence of any traitor, every general sends his input (attack or retreat) to every
other general. We will refer to these inputs as orders. These inputs need not be the same.
The principle of reaching agreement is that every loyal general eventually collects the
identical bag S of orders and applies the same choice function on S to decide the final
strategy.
13.3.2 Solution with Traitors: Interactive Consistency Criteria
The task of collecting S can be divided into a number of subtasks. Each subtask consists of
a particular general i broadcasting his order to every other general. Each general plays the
role of the commander when he broadcasts and the role of a lieutenant when he receives an
order from another general (playing the role of the commander).
278 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Some generals can be traitors. When a loyal commander broadcasts his order to the
lieutenants, every loyal lieutenant receives the same order. This may not be true when
the commander is a traitor, since he can say attack to some lieutenants and retreat to the
others. The precise requirements of the communication between a commander and his
lieutenants are defined by the following two interactive consistency criteria:
IC1: Every loyal lieutenant receives the same order from the commander.
IC2: If the commander is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant receives the order that the
commander sends.
Regardless of whether the commander is a traitor, IC1 can be satisfied as long as every
loyal lieutenant receives the same order. However, it does not preclude the awkward case
in which the commander sends the order attack, but all lieutenants receive the order
retreat, which satisfies IC1! This justifies the inclusion of IC2. When the commander is
loyal, IC2 holds, and IC1 follows from IC2.
Satisfying the interactive consistency criteria while collecting the order from a commander
who is a potential traitor can be complex. This is illustrated in the subsequent
sections.
13.3.3 Consensus with Oral Messages
The solution to the byzantine generals problem depends on the model of message communication.
The oral message model satisfies the following three conditions:
1. Messages are not corrupted in transit.
2. Messages can be lost, but the absence of message can be detected.
3. When a message is received (or its absence is detected), the receiver knows the identity
of the sender (or the defaulter).
The corruption of a message can be attributed to the sender sending a different order—
a behavior that is well captured under the byzantine failure model, so allowing the messages
to be corrupted in transit does not add any more value to the fault model. Let m represent
the number of traitors. An algorithm that satisfies IC1 and IC2 using the oral message
model of communication in the presence of at most m traitors will be called an OM(m)
algorithm. The OM(0) algorithm is based on direct communication only: The commander
sends his order to every lieutenant, and the lieutenants receive these orders that are sent.
However when m > 0, direct communication is not adequate. To check for possible
inconsistencies, a loyal (and wise) lieutenant would also like to know from every other
lieutenant, “What did the commander tell you?” The answers to these questions constitute
the indirect messages. Note that not only the commander but also some of the fellow lieutenants
may be traitors. The actual order accepted by a lieutenant from the commander
will depend on both direct and indirect messages.
Distributed Consensus ◾ 279
13.3.3.1 Impossibility Result
An important impossibility result is that, using oral messages, no solution to the byzantine
generals problem exists with three or fewer generals and one traitor.
The two-general case is clearly not interesting—if there is a traitor, then the loyal general
does not have to agree with anyone, and the problem becomes vacuous. To motivate the
readers, consider an example with three generals and one traitor. Figure 13.3a shows the
case when the commander is loyal, but lieutenant 2 is a traitor. We use the values 0 and 1
in place of attack and retreat, respectively. For lieutenant 1, the direct message from the
commander is 1, and the indirect message received through lieutenant 2 (who altered the
message) is 0. To satisfy IC2, lieutenant 1 must choose the first element from the ordered
set (direct message, indirect message) as the order from the commander.
Now consider the scenario of Figure 13.3b, where the commander is a traitor. If the
lieutenants use the same choice function as in the previous case, then IC1 is violated.
Since no loyal lieutenant has a prior knowledge about who is faulty, there will always exist
a case in which either IC1 or IC2 will be violated. These form the seeds of the impossibility
result. A more formal proof of this impossibility result (adapted from [FLM86]) is
presented in the following.
Theorem 13.2
Using oral messages, there is no solution to the byzantine generals problem when there are
three generals and one traitor.
Proof (by contradiction): Assume that there exists a solution to the byzantine generals
problem for a system S consisting of the generals P, Q, R (Figure 13.4a), of which one is
a traitor. In Figure 13.4b, define another system SS that consists of two copies of each
general—P′,Q′,R′ are clones of P, Q, R, respectively. Note that based on the local knowledge
about his own neighborhood, no general can distinguish whether it belongs to S or SS. We
call them look-alike systems.
Assume that in SS, each process is nonfaulty. Also, each of the generals P,Q,R′ has an initial
value x, and each of the other generals P′,Q′,R has a different initial value y (i.e., x ≠ y).
System SS can mimic at least three separate instances of a three-general system in which one

can be a potential traitor: for example, R and R′ present to P, Q with two different versions
of their values (orders), Q and Q′ do the same to R, P′, and so on.
To P and Q in SS, it will appear that they are a part of a three-general system like S in
which R is faulty. Since both P and Q have initial values x, their final decision must also be x.
To P′ and R in SS, it will appear that they are a part of a three-general system like S in
which Q is faulty. Since both P′ and R have initial values y, their final orders must also be y.
Now, to Q and R in SS, it will appear that they are a part of a three-general system like
S in which P is faulty. But they cannot reach consensus, since Q has already chosen x, and
R has already chosen y as their final decision. Therefore, a three-general system with one
traitor cannot reach consensus.
Corollary 13.1
Using oral messages, no solution to the byzantine generals problem exists with 3m or fewer
generals and m traitors (m > 0).
Proof (contradiction): Assume that the statement is false, that is, a solution to the byzantine
generals problem exists with 3m or fewer generals and m traitors. Then we can use it to construct
a solution to the case of three generals and one traitor in the following way: Divide the 3m
generals into three groups of m generals each, such that all the traitors are put in one group. Let
a general simulate the members of each of these groups. The general that simulates the group of
m traitors mimics the actions of a single traitor, whereas the other two mimic the loyal generals.
Since we know that it is impossible to construct a solution with three generals and one
traitor, we have a contradiction.
13.3.3.2 OM(m) Algorithm
It follows from Corollary 13.1 that in order to reach a consensus in the presence of m traitors,
n ≥ 3m+1 generals are needed. Recall that OM(m) refers to an algorithm that satisfies
the interactive consistency criteria IC1 and IC2 in the presence of at most m traitors. In
Lamport et al. [LSP82], proposed the following version of OM(m). The algorithm is recursive:
OM(m) invokes OM(m − 1), which invokes OM(m − 2) and so on.

Algorithm OM(0)
1. Commander i sends out a value v ∈ {0, 1} to every lieutenant j ≠ i.
2. Each lieutenant j accepts the value from i as the order from commander i.
Algorithm OM(m)
1. Commander i sends out a value v ∈ {0, 1} to every lieutenant j ≠ i.
2. If m > 0, then each lieutenant j, after receiving a value from the commander, starts a
new phase by broadcasting it to the remaining lieutenants using OM(m − 1). In this
phase, j acts as the commander. Each lieutenant thus receives (n − 1) values: (a) a
value directly received from the commander i of OM(m) and (b) (n − 2) values indirectly
received from the (n − 2) lieutenants resulting from their broadcast OM(m − 1).
If a value is not received, then it is substituted by a default value.
3. Each lieutenant chooses the majority of the (n − 1) values received by it as the order
from the commander i.
Figure 13.5 illustrates the OM(1) algorithm with four generals and one traitor. The commander’s
id is 0. In part (a), lieutenant 3 is a traitor, so he broadcasts a 0 even if he has
received a 1 from the commander. Per the algorithm, each of the loyal lieutenants 1 and 2
chooses the majority of {1, 1, 0}, that is, 1. In part (b), commander 0 is a traitor and broadcasts
conflicting messages. However, all three loyal lieutenants eventually decide on the
same final value, which is the majority of {1, 0, 1}, that is, 1.
The algorithm progresses in rounds. Algorithm OM(0) requires one round, and OM(m)
requires m + 1 rounds to complete. As the recursion unfolds, OM(m) invokes n − 1 separate
executions of OM(m − 1), each OM(m − 1) invokes n − 2 separate executions of OM(m − 2),
and so on. This continues until OM(0) is reached. The total number of messages required in
the OM(m) algorithm is therefore (n−1)(n−2)(n−3)⋯(n−m+1), that is, O(nm).
Figure 13.6 illustrates the execution of the OM(m) algorithm with m = 2 and n = 7. Each

every lieutenant. The lieutenants 1 and 3 are traitors. The diagram does not show values
of the messages from the traitors, but you can assume any arbitrary value for them. Loyal
commanders 2, 4, 5, 6 receive the direct message 1 and initiate OM(1). Each OM(1) triggers
an instance of OM(0), and the unfolding of the recursion ends.
At the OM(1) level, let us focus on 5. What message did 5 receive from 2 via OM(1)?
Lieutenant 5 is eligible to receive five messages at this level: a direct message 1 from 2 and
four other messages from 4, 6, 1, and 3. Nothing can be said about what 5 would receive
from 1 or 3, since they are traitors. But as Figure 13.6 shows, 5 received a 1 from each of 4
and 6. So 5 received three 1s out of the five values that it can receive, and the majority is 1.
Use similar arguments and observe that 5 received a 1 from 4 and 6 too via OM(1). At the
OM(2) level, each lieutenant collects at least four 1s out of the maximum six values that it
can receive, and the majority is 1. This reflects the order from commander 0. Any misinformation
sent by the traitors is clearly voted out, and the final results satisfy the interactive
consistency criteria IC1 and IC2.
In case the decision value is not binary, the function majority may be replaced by the
function median to reach agreement.
Proof of the oral message algorithm
Lemma 13.4
Let the commander be loyal, and n > 2m + k, where m = maximum number of traitors.
Then OM(k) satisfies IC2.
Proof (by induction):
Basis: When k = 0, the theorem is trivially true.
Induction hypothesis: Assume that the theorem holds for k = r (r > 0), that is, OM(r)
satisfies IC2. We need to show that it holds for k = r + 1.
Inductive step: Consider an OM(r + 1) algorithm initiated by a loyal commander. Here,
n > 2m + r + 1 (from the statement of the theorem), so n − 1 > 2m + r (Figure 13.7).

Distributed Consensus ◾ 283
After the commander sends out a value, each of the remaining (n − 1) lieutenants initiates
OM(r). According to the induction hypothesis, OM(r) satisfies IC2—so every loyal lieutenant
receives the same order via OM(r) from every other loyal lieutenant. Now n − 1 >
2m + r, which implies n − m − 1 > m + r > m. This shows that a majority of the lieutenants
are loyal. So, regardless of the values sent by the m traitors, the majority of the (n − 1) values
collected by each lieutenant, including the direct message from the loyal commander, must
be v. So, IC2 is satisfied.
Theorem 13.3
If >3m where m is the maximum number of traitors, then OM(m) satisfies both IC1 and IC2.
Proof (by induction):
Basis: When m = 0, the theorem trivially holds.
Induction hypothesis: Assume that the theorem holds for m = r. We need to show it holds
for OM(r + 1) too.
Inductive step: Substitute k = m in Lemma 13.4 and consider the following two cases:
Case 1: The commander is loyal. Then OM(m) satisfies IC2 and hence IC1.
Case 2: The commander is a traitor. Then there are more than 3(r + 1) generals and
at most (r + 1) traitors. This implies that there are more than (3r + 2) lieutenants
remaining, of which at most r are traitors, and more than (2r + 2) are loyal. Since
(3r + 2) > 3r, by the induction hypothesis, OM(r) satisfies IC1 and IC2.
In OM(r + 1), a loyal lieutenant chooses the majority from (1) the values from more than
(2r + 1) loyal lieutenants obtained via OM(r), (2) the values received from at most r traitors
via OM(r), and (3) the value sent by the commander, who is a traitor. Since OM(r) satisfies
IC1 and IC2, the values collected in part (1) are the same for all loyal lieutenants—it is
the same value that the lieutenants received from the commander. Also, by the induction
hypothesis, the loyal lieutenants will receive the same value via OM(r) from each of the
r traitors, regardless of what they send. So every loyal lieutenant will collect the same set
of values, apply the same choice function, and reach the same final decision.

13.3.4 Consensus Using Signed Messages
The communication model of signed message satisfies all the conditions of the model of
oral message. In addition, it satisfies two extra conditions:
1. A loyal general’s signature cannot be forged, that is, any forgery can be detected.
2. Anyone can verify the authenticity of a signature.
In real life, signature is an encryption technique. Authentication methods to detect possible
forgery are discussed in Chapter 19. The existence of a safeguard against the forgery
of signed messages can be leveraged to find out simpler solutions to the consensus problem.
So if the commander sends a 0 to every lieutenant {0, 1, 2, …, n − 1}, but lieutenant 2 tells
lieutenant 1: “the commander sent me a 1,” then lieutenant 1 can immediately detect it and
discard the message. The signed message algorithm also exhibits better resilience to faulty
behaviors.
We begin with an example to illustrate interactive consistency with three generals and
one traitor using signed messages. The notation v{S} will represent a signed message, where
v is a value initiated by general i and S is a signature list consisting of the sequence of signatures
by the generals i, j, k, …. Each signature is essentially an encryption mechanism
using the sender’s private key. Loyal generals try to decrypt or decipher it using a public
key. If that is not possible, then the message must be forged and is discarded. The number
of entries in S will be called the length of S.
In Figure 13.8a, lieutenant 1 will detect that lieutenant 2 forged the message from the
commander, and reject the message. In Figure 13.8b, the commander is a traitor, but no
message is forged. Both 1 and 2 will discover that the commander sent out inconsistent
values. To reach an agreement, both of them will apply some mutually agreed choice function
f on the collected bag of messages and make the same final decision. Note that this
satisfies both IC1 and IC2.

Distributed Consensus ◾ 285
In contrast with the OM(m) algorithm, the signed message version SM(m) satisfies both
IC1 and IC2 whenever n ≥ m + 2, so it has a much better resilience against faulty behavior.
The algorithm SM(m) is described in the following:
Algorithm SM(m)
1. Commander i sends out a signed message v{i} to every lieutenant j ≠ i.
2. Lieutenant j, after receiving a message v{S}, adds it to a set V · j, only if
(i) It is not forged
(ii) It has not been received before
3. If the length of S is less than m + 1, then lieutenant j
(i) Appends his own signature to S
(ii) Sends V · j it to every other lieutenant whose signature does not appear in S
4. When lieutenant j receives no more messages, he applies a choice function on V · j to
generate the final decision.
The only requirements on the choice function are (1) when V · j contains a single element
v, choice(V · i) = v, (2) when V · i = Ø, choice(V · i) = 0 and (3) when |V · i| > 1, the median
element is returned, assuming that the elements are ordered.
Theorem 13.4
If n ≥ m + 2, where m is the maximum number of traitors, then SM(m) satisfies both IC1
and IC2.
Proof: Consider the following two cases:
Case 1: Assume that the commander is loyal. Then every loyal lieutenant i must receive
the value v from the initial broadcast. Since forged messages are discarded, any other
value indirectly received and accepted by a loyal lieutenant must be v. Since the only
message in the set V · i is v, choice(V · i) = v. This satisfies both IC1 and IC2.
Case 2: Assume that the commander is a traitor. We argue that for a pair of loyal lieutenants
i and j, V · i = V · j. If length(S) < m + 1, then i sends to j every message that he
accepts, and vice versa. If length(S) = m + 1, then at least one loyal lieutenant must
have signed the message and sent it to i and j, so it appears in both V · i and V · i.
Therefore, V · i = V · j. Application of the choice function on the sets V · i and V · j will
lead to the same final decision by both i and j. This satisfies IC1.
SM(m) begins by sending up to (n − 1) messages, each recipient of this message sends up
to (n − 2) messages and so on. So, to reach an agreement, it will cost (n − 1)(n − 2) ⋯
(n − m + 1) messages. The message complexity is thus similar to that of OM(m). However,
for the same value of n, the signed message algorithm has much better resilience, that is, it
tolerates a much larger number of traitors.
286 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
13.4 PAXOS ALGORITHM
Paxos is an algorithm for implementing fault-tolerant consensus. It runs on a completely
connected network of n processes and tolerates up to m failures, where n ≥ 2m + 1. Processes
can crash and messages may be lost, but byzantine failures are ruled out, at least in the current
version. The algorithm solves the consensus problem in the presence of these faults on
an asynchronous system of processes. Although the requirements for consensus are agreement,
validity, and termination, Paxos primarily guarantees agreement and validity, and
not termination—it allows for the possibility of termination only if there is a sufficiently
long interval during which no process restarts the protocol.
A process may play three different roles: proposer, acceptor, and learner. Each role has a
different responsibility: Proposers submit proposed values on behalf of clients, acceptors
decide the candidate values for the final decision, and learners collect these information
from the acceptors and report the final decision back to the clients. A proposal sent by a
proposer is a pair (v, n) where v is a value and n is a sequence number. If there is only one
acceptor that decides which value will be chosen as the consensus value, then it will be too
simplistic. What if the acceptor crashes? To deal with this, there are multiple acceptors.
A proposal must be endorsed by at least one acceptor before it becomes a candidate for the
final decision. The sequence number is used to distinguish between successive attempts
to invoke the protocol. Upon receiving a proposal with a larger sequence number from a
given process, acceptors discard the proposals with lower sequence numbers. Eventually,
an acceptor accepts the majority’s choice. The sequence of actions is as follows:
Phase 1: The preparatory phase
Step 1.1: Each proposer sends a proposal (v, n) to each acceptor (Figure 13.9).
Step 1.2: If n is the largest sequence number of a proposal received by an acceptor, then it sends
an ack(n, ⊥, ⊥) to its proposer, which is a promise that it will ignore all proposals numbered
lowered than n. However, in case an acceptor has accepted a proposal with a sequence
number n′ < n and a proposed value v, it responds with ack(n, v, n′). This implies that the
proposer has no point in trying to submit another proposal with a larger sequence number.

Distributed Consensus ◾ 287
An alternative is to respond to the proposer with a negative acknowledgment (nack) that
discourages the proposer to force an agreement with new input values. Note that this is a
performance issue and does not affect the correctness of the protocol. When there are two
proposals with identical sequence numbers, the tie is broken using the process ids.
Phase 2: Request for acceptance of an input value
Step 2.1: If a proposer receives ack(n, ⊥, ⊥) from a majority of acceptors, then it sends
accept(v, n) to all acceptors, asking them to accept this value. If however, an acceptor
returned an ack(n, v, n′) to the proposer in phase 1 (which means that it already
accepted proposal with value v) then the proposer must include the value v with the
highest sequence number in its request to the acceptors.
Step 2.2: An acceptor accepts a proposal (v, n) unless it has already promised to consider
proposals with a sequence number greater than n.
Phase 3: The final decision
When a majority of the acceptors accept a proposed value, it becomes the final decision
value. The acceptors multicast the accepted value to the learners, which enables them to
determine if a proposal has been accepted by a majority of acceptors. The learners convey
it to the client processes invoking the consensus.
The following two observations highlight the properties of the algorithm:
Observation 1: An acceptor accepts a proposal with a sequence number n if it has not
sent a promise to any proposal with a sequence number n′ > n.
Observation 2: If a proposer sends an accept(v, n) message in phase 2, then either no
acceptor in a majority has accepted a proposal with a sequence number n′ < n, or
v is the value in the highest numbered proposal among all accepted proposals with
sequence numbers n′ < n accepted by at least one acceptor in a majority.
13.4.1 Safety Properties
The two important safety properties are as follows:
Validity: Only a proposed value can be chosen as the final decision.
Agreement: Two different processes cannot make different decisions.
The validity part is obvious, so let us argue that the agreement property will hold. By definition,
a decision value is endorsed by a majority of acceptors. Since the intersection of two
majorities is nonempty, and any acceptor will accept only one value in one instance of the
protocol, the final decision is unique.
Note that no process learns that a value has been decided unless it actually has been
decided. For this, a learner has to find out that a proposal has been accepted by a majority
of acceptors. Acceptors can communicate directly to the learners or communicate through
some distinguished learner—the latter approach will reduce the message complexity, but
288 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
can fall apart when the distinguished learner fails. Since messages can be lost, a value can
be chosen without any learner finding out about it. The failure of one or more acceptors
can make it impossible for a learner to find out whether a value received the endorsement
of the majority, even if it did so. After a while, the proposer will restart the protocol with a
higher sequence number, until a decision is reached.
13.4.2 Liveness Properties
It is possible for multiple proposers to submit proposals with increasing values of sequence
numbers in such a manner that none of those are ever accepted. Consider the following
sequence of events:
• (Phase 1) Proposer 1 sends out prepare(n1).
• (Phase 1) Proposer 2 sends out prepare(n2) where n2 > n1.
• (Phase 2) Proposer 1’s accept(n1) is declined, since the acceptor has already promised
to proposer 2 that it will not accept any proposal numbered lower than n2 so
proposer 1 restarts phase 1 with a higher number n3 > n2.
• (Phase 2) Proposer 2’s accept request is now declined on a similar ground.
The race can go on forever, stalling progress. One way out is to elect a single proposer
and entrust it with the responsibility of sending proposals on behalf of clients. However,
leader election itself is a consensus problem that may not be solvable in an asynchronous
setting using deterministic algorithms. To elect a leader, either a randomized algorithm or
a timeout-based solution should be adopted. Multiple proposers can however be present
when one crashes at the middle of a negotiation, leading another proposer to take over.
A sample trace is illustrated in the following:
• (Phase 1) Proposer sends prepare(n1) to acceptors 1, 2, 3.
• (Phase 1) Acceptors respond with the promise of not accepting a proposal with a
sequence number less than n1.
• (Phase 2) Proposer receives the promise, sends accept(n1), and then becomes
nonresponsive.
At this time, a new proposer will be elected who will take over the unfinished task from
proposer 1. But the old proposer may not have crashed; it was perhaps executing its actions
slowly. One method of terminating a race among multiple proposers is to use the idea of
exponential backoff as in the Ethernet—a proposer receiving a nack will randomly choose
a large delay before starting the next round. With probability 1, this will create a largeenough
time gap between the two proposers caught in a race, and one will soon get done
without interference.
Distributed Consensus ◾ 289
13.5 FAILURE DETECTORS
The design of fault-tolerant systems will be simple if faulty processes can be reliably
detected. Here are three scenarios highlighting the importance of failure detection:
Scenario 1: In a sensor network, a base station delegates the task of monitoring an environment
to a set of geographically dispersed sensor nodes. These sensors send the
monitored values back to the base station. If a sensor node crashes, and the crash is
reliably detected, then its task can be assigned to another sensor.
Scenario 2: In group-oriented activities, sometimes a task is divided among the members
of a group. If a member crashes, or a member voluntarily leaves the group, then
the other members can take over the task of the failed member only if they can detect
the failure.
Scenario 3: Distributed consensus, which is at the heart of numerous coordination problems,
has trivially simple solution if there is a reliable failure detection service. In the
byzantine generals problem, if the traitors could be reliably identified, then consensus
could be reached by ignoring the inputs from the traitors.
We focus on the detection of crash failures only. In synchronous distributed systems where
message delays have upper bounds and processor speeds have lower bounds, timeouts are
used to detect faulty processes. In purely asynchronous systems, we cannot distinguish
between a process that has crashed and one that is running very slowly. Consequently, the
detection of crash failures in asynchronous systems poses an intriguing challenge.
A failure detector is a service that generates a list of processes that are suspected to have
failed. Each process has a local detector that coordinates with its counterparts in other processes
to provide the failure detection service. For asynchronous systems, the individual
detection mechanisms are unreliable and error prone. Processes are suspected based on
local observations or indirect information, and different processes may have different list
of suspects. One way to compile a suspect list is to send a probe to all other processes with
a request to respond. If a process does not respond within a specified period, then it is suspected
to have crashed. The list of suspects is influenced by how long a process waits for the
response, and the failure scenario. If the waiting time is too short, then every process might
appear to be a suspect. Again, if a process i receives two probes from j and k, responds to j,
and then crashes—then j will treat i to be a correct process, but k will suspect i as a crashed
process. Even the detector itself might be a suspect. The study of failure detectors examines
how such unreliable failure detectors may coordinate with one another in the design of
fault-tolerant systems.
To relate the list of suspects with processes that have actually crashed, we begin with
two basic properties of a failure detector:
Completeness: Every crashed process is suspected.
Accuracy: No correct process is suspected.
290 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Completeness alone is of little use, since a detector that suspects every process is trivially
complete. Similarly, accuracy alone is of little use, since a detector that does not suspect
any process is trivially accurate. It is a combination of both properties that makes a failure
detector meaningful, even if it is unreliable.
Note that completeness is a liveness property. Correct processes may not be able to suspect
the crashed process immediately after the crash occurs—it is ok if it is recognized
after a finite period of time. Accuracy, on the other hand, is a safety property. Two extreme
forms of completeness are as follows:
Strong completeness: Every crashed process is eventually suspected by every correct process
and remains a suspect thereafter.
Weak completeness: Every crashed process is eventually suspected by at least one correct
process and remains a suspect thereafter.
The above definitions are completely independent of the actual mechanism for constructing
the suspect list, although readers may find it helpful to visualize heartbeat messages
and timeout as tools. Based on the communication history over a period of time, each process
draws such a list. Later, if a process receives a message from a member of its suspect
list, or learns from another process that the suspect has not crashed, then it will remove
that member from the suspect list. There is a straightforward implementation of strong
completeness using weak completeness:
program strong completeness (program for process i};
define D: set of process ids (representing the set of suspects);
initially D is generated by the weakly complete detector;
do true →
send D(i)) to every process j ≠ i;
receive D(i) from every process j ≠ i;
D(i) : = D(i) ∪ D(j);
if j ∈ D(i) →D(i):=D(i)\{j} fi {sender of a message is not a
suspect}
od
The rationale behind the implementation is that, since every crashed process is suspected
by at least one correct process, at the end, every D(i) of every correct process will contain
all the suspects. Henceforth, we will only consider the strong completeness property.
Like completeness, one can define two forms of accuracy:
Strong accuracy: No correct process is ever suspected.
Weak accuracy: There is at least one correct process that is never suspected.
Both versions of accuracy can be further weakened using the attribute eventually. A failure
detector is eventually strongly accurate if there exists a time T after which no correct
Distributed Consensus ◾ 291
process is suspected. Before that time, a correct process may be added to and removed
from the list of suspects any number of times. Similarly, a failure detector is eventually
weakly accurate if there exists a time T after which at least one correct process is no more
suspected, although before that time, every correct process could be a suspect. We will use
the symbol ◊ (borrowed from temporal logic) to represent the attribute eventually.
By combining the strong completeness property with the four types of accuracy, we can
define the following four classes of fault detectors:
Perfect P: (Strongly) Complete and strongly accurate
Strong S: (Strongly) Complete and weakly accurate
Eventually perfect ◊P: (Strongly) Complete and eventually strongly accurate
Eventually strong ◊S: (Strongly) Complete and eventually weakly accurate
Admittedly, other classes of failure detectors can also be defined. One class of failure detector
that combines the weak completeness and weak accuracy properties has received substantial
attention. It is known as the weak (W) failure detector. The weakest detector in this
hierarchy is the eventually weak failure detector ◊W.
Chandra and Toueg introduced failure detectors to tackle the impossibility of consensus in
asynchronous distributed systems [FLP85]. Accordingly, the issues to examine are as follows:
1. Given a failure detector of a certain type, how can we solve the consensus problem?
2. How can we implement these classes of failure detectors in asynchronous distributed
systems?
13.5.1 Solving Consensus Using Failure Detectors
Any implementation of a failure detector, even an unreliable one, uses timeout in a direct or
indirect way. Synchronous systems with bounded message delays and processor speeds can
reliably implement a perfect failure detector using timeout. Given a perfect failure detector
(P), we can easily solve the consensus problem in both synchronous and asynchronous distributed
systems. However, on an asynchronous model, we cannot implement P—its properties
are too strong. This motivates us to look for weaker classes of failure detectors that
can solve asynchronous consensus. For such weak classes, we hope to find an approximate
implementation—and the weaker the class, the narrower is the gap between the constraints
they satisfy, and what a real implementation can offer (although such approximations have
not been quantified). The interesting observation is that we know the end result—no failure
detector that can be implemented will solve asynchronous consensus, because that would
violate the FLP impossibility result. The intellectually stimulating question is the quest for
the weakest class of failure detectors that can solve consensus. A related issue is to explore
the implementation of some of the stronger classes of failure detectors using weaker classes.
In this section, we present two different solutions to the consensus problem, each using
a different type of failure detector.
292 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
13.5.1.1 Consensus Using P
A perfect failure detector lets each correct process receive inputs from every other correct
process. Assume that up to t out of the n processes can crash. The underlying mechanism
behind reaching consensus is reliable multicast. For every process p, let Vp be a vector of size n,
the ith component of which represents the input from process i. If each process multicasts its
input value to others, then everyone will receive an identical set of values, apply a choice function,
and reach a consensus. But each multicast is a sequence of unicasts, and the sender may
crash at the middle, which complicates matters. Reliable multicast overcomes this, and implements
atomicity of the multicast by continuing the multicast for (t + 1) asynchronous rounds
(Figure 13.10), after which the Vp of each correct process p becomes identical, and contains the
inputs from all processes whose multicasts reached some correct process at least once.
The algorithm runs in two phases. The computation progresses in rounds. The rounds are
asynchronous, and each process p keeps track of its own round number rp. In each round of
phase 1, every process p exchanges its Vp with other processes. If p receives no message from
q ≠ p, and no other process reports to p about receiving a message from q, then p sets Vp[q]
to ⊥ (undefined input). The algorithm guarantees that at the end of phase 1, ∀p, q: Vp = Vq.
Phase 2 generates the final decision value for each process. The steps are outlined as follows:
program Consensus with P {program for process p}
define Vp, Dp: array [0..n − 1] of input values
initially Vp=(⊥,⊥,⊥,…,⊥)
Vp[p]:=input of p;Dp:=Vp;rp:=1
(Phase 1)
do rp<t+1→
send (rp,Dp,p) to each q ≠ p;
wait for (rp,Dp,q) from all each q ≠ p;{or q becomes a
suspect}

13.5.1.2 Consensus Using S
Chandra and Toueg proposed the following algorithm for asynchronous consensus
using a strong failure detector S. This algorithm is structurally similar to the previous
algorithm, but runs in three phases. Phase 1 is similar to the first phase of the
previous algorithm. However, recall that the weak accuracy property of S allows some
correct processes to be suspected by other correct processes—somehow, a few correct
processes may not receive the messages from a few other correct processes. As a
result, the values of Vp for each process p may not be identical after phase 1. Phase 2
takes additional steps that enable each nonfaulty process p to refine its Vp, so that they
become identical for all nonfaulty process. Phase 3 generates the final decision value
using a choice function.
program Consensus with S {program for process p}
define Vp, Dp: array[0..n−1] of input values
initially Vp=(⊥,⊥,⊥,…,⊥)
Vp[p]:= input of p; Dp:=Vp; rp:=1

send (rp,Dp,p) to each q ≠ p;
wait for (rq,Dq,q) from all each q ≠ p; {or q becomes a suspect}
for k = 0 to n − 1
if ∃ (rq,Dq,q):Dq[k] = ⊥ ∧ Vp[k] ≠ ⊥ →
Vp[k]: = ⊥; Dp[k]: = ⊥
fi
(Phase 3) Decide on the first element Vp [j]: Vp [j] ≠ ⊥
13.5.1.3 Rationale
At the end of phase 1, Vp may not be identical for every correct process p. The action
∃ (rq, Dq, q): Dq[k] = ⊥∧ Vp[k] ≠ ⊥ → Vp[k]: = ⊥; Dp[k]: = ⊥ (in phase 2) helps p realize that
q did not receive the input from process k and prompts p to delete the controversial input
from Vp. As a result, when phase 2 ends, ∀p,q : Vp = Vq holds. Since there is at least one correct
process that is not suspected by any correct process, at least of one of the elements in Vp
contains a valid input value. Therefore, phase 3 produces a common value for every process.
294 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
13.5.1.4 Implementing a Failure Detector
There is no magic in the implementation of a failure detector. Such implementations invariably
depend on timeout and some secondary information about suspects observed and
propagated by other processes. By extending the timeout period, one can only get a better
estimate of the list of suspects. Since a weak failure detector has fewer requirements, the
implementations better approximate the weaker version than the stronger versions.
13.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS
While distributed consensus in asynchronous distributed systems has been a rich area of theoretical
research, most practical applications rely on synchronous or partially synchronous
models. For consensus in the presence of byzantine failure, the signed message algorithm
has much better resiliency compared to the oral message version. Dolev and Strong [DS82]
demonstrated a solution to byzantine consensus in polynomial time. Dolev [D82] also studied
the byzantine consensus problem in topologies that are not completely connected and
demonstrated that to tolerate m failures, the graph should be at least (2m + 1) connected.
The Paxos algorithm has several variations. Google used Paxos in their Chubby faulttolerant
system [B06] that implements a distributed locking mechanism for data centers.
Chubby uses replication for fault tolerance.
Failure detector is an important component of group communication service. The
emphasis of the work is on the classification of detectors, on their computing powers, and
on the various methods of simulating stronger classes of detectors from the weaker ones.
In [CT96], Chandra and Toueg showed that the eventually weak failure detector ◊W, which
provides very little information about which processes have crashed, is sufficient to solve
consensus in asynchronous systems with a majority of correct processes. Also, failure
detectors that are perpetually accurate (like P, S) can solve consensus with any number of
failures, whereas failure detectors with eventual accuracy solve consensus if and only if a
majority of the processes are correct.
All results in this chapter use the deterministic model of computation. Many impossibility
results can be circumvented when a probabilistic model of computation is used (see
Ben-Or’s paper [B83]). These solutions have not been addressed here.
13.7 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Fischer et al. [FLP85] presented the impossibility of distributed consensus in asynchronous
distributed systems. During the ACM PODC 2001 Conference, the distributed systems
(PODC) community voted this paper as the most influential paper in the field (later
renamed as Dijkstra Prize after Edsger W. Dijkstra since 2003).
Byzantine failures were identified by Wensley et al. in the SIFT project [WLGt78] for
aircraft control. The two algorithms for solving byzantine agreement are due to Lamport
et al. [LSP82]. This paper started a flurry of research activities during the second half of the
1980s. The proof of the impossibility of byzantine agreement with three generals and one
traitor is adapted from Fischer et al. [FLM86], where a general framework of such proofs
has been suggested. Lamport [L83] also studied a weaker version of byzantine agreement
that required the validity criterion to hold only when there are no faulty processes.
Distributed Consensus ◾ 295
The polynomial time algorithm for byzantine consensus can be found in [DS82]. Dolev
[D82] also studied byzantine agreement in networks that are not completely connected.
Coan et al. [CDD+85] studied a different version of agreement called the distributed firing
squad problem, where the goal is to enable processes to start an action at the same time:
If any correct process receives a message to start DFS synchronization, then eventually all
correct processes will execute the fire action at the same step.
A simple description of the basic Paxos algorithm is available in Lamport’s article [L01].
Burrows described the Chubby distributed locking service in [B06].
Chandra and Toueg [CT96] introduced failure detectors. Their aim was to cope with the
well-known impossibility result by Fischer et al. [FLP85] for asynchronous distributed systems.
The result on the weakest failure detector for solving consensus appears in [CHT96].
In 2010, Chandra and Toueg received the Dijkstra prize for their contributions in failure
detectors.
EXERCISES
13.1 Seven members of a family interviewed a candidate for the open position of a cook.
If the communication is purely asynchronous and message-based, and decisions are
based on majority votes, then describe a scenario to show how the family can remain
undecided, when one member disappears after the interview.
13.2 Present an example to show that in a synchronous system, byzantine agreement
cannot be reached using the oral message algorithm when there are six generals and
two traitors.
13.3 Two loyal generals are planning to coordinate their actions for conquering a strategic
town. To conquer the town, they need to attack at the same time; otherwise, if
only one of them attacks and the other does not attack at the same time, then the
generals are likely to be defeated. To plan the attack, they send messages back and
forth via trusted messengers. The communication is asynchronous. However, the
messengers can be killed or captured—so the communication is unreliable.
Argue why it is impossible for the two generals to coordinate their actions of
attacking at the same time.
(Hint: Unlike the byzantine generals problem, here all generals are loyal, but the
communication is unreliable. If general A sends a message attack at 2 a.m. to general
B, then he will want an acknowledgment from B; otherwise, he won’t attack in
the fear of moving alone. But B also will ask for an acknowledgment of the acknowledgment.
Now you see the rest of the story.)
13.4 Prove that in a connected network of generals, it is impossible to reach byzantine
agreement with n generals and m traitors, the connectivity of the graph ≤ 2m + 1.
(The connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of nodes whose removal
results in a partition.) (See [D82]).
13.5 A synchronous distributed system consists of 2n processes, and its topology is an
n-dimensional hypercube. What is the maximum number of byzantine failures that
296 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
can be tolerated when the processes want to reach a consensus? [The result should
follow from Q4.]
13.6 Using oral messages, the byzantine generals algorithm helps reach a consensus
when less than one-third of the generals are traitors. However, it does not suggest
how to identify the traitors. Examine if the traitors can be identified without any
ambiguity.
13.7 In the context of failure detectors in asynchronous distributed systems, eventual
accuracy is a weaker version of the accuracy property of failure detectors; however,
there is no mention of the eventual completeness property. Why is it so?
13.8 If one can design a perfect failure detector, then consensus problems can be easily
solved. What are the hurdles in the practical implementation of a perfect failure
detector?
13.9 Implement a perfect failure detector P using an eventually perfect failure detector ◊P.

network, each process has a perfect failure detector. How can you elect a leader

Distributed Transactions
14.1 INTRODUCTION
Amy wakes up in the morning and decides to transfer a sum of $200 from her savings
account in Colorado to her checking account in Iowa City where the balance is so low that
she cannot write a check to pay her apartment rent. She logs into her home computer and
executes the transfer that is translated into a sequence of the following two operations:
• Withdraw $200 from Colorado State bank account 4311182.
• Deposit the said amount into Iowa State bank account 6761125.
The next day, she writes a check to pay her rent. Unfortunately, her check bounced.
Furthermore, it was found that $200 was debited from her Colorado account, but due to a
server failure in Iowa City, no money was deposited to her Iowa account.
Amy’s transactions had an undesirable end result. A transaction is a sequence of server
operations that must be carried out atomically (which means that either all operations
must be executed or none of them will be executed at all). Amy’s bank operations violated
the atomicity property of transactions and caused problems for her. Certainly this is not
desirable. It also violated a consistency property that corresponds to the fact that the total
money in Amy’s accounts will remain unchanged during a transfer operation. A transaction
commits when all of its operations complete successfully and the states are appropriately
updated. Otherwise, the transaction aborts, which implies no change will take place
and the old state will be retained.
In real life, all transactions must satisfy the following four properties regardless of server
crashes or omission failures:
Atomicity: Either all operations are completed or none of them is executed.
Consistency: Regardless of what happens, the database must remain consistent. In this
case, Amy’s total balance must remain unchanged.
298 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Isolation: If multiple transactions run concurrently, then it must appear as if they were
executed in some arbitrary sequential order. The updates of one transaction must not
be visible to another transaction until it commits.
Durability: Once a transaction commits, its effect will be permanent.
These four properties are collectively known as ACID properties, a term coined by Härder
and Reuter [HR83]. The implementation of these goals is the main task in the implementation
of a transaction. Readers may wonder whether these properties could be enforced via
mutual exclusion algorithms, by treating the transaction as a critical section. In principle,
this would have been possible, if there were no failures. However, mutual exclusion algorithms
discussed so far rule out failures, so newer methods are required for the implementation
of transactions.
14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS
Transactions can be classified into several different categories. A few of these are listed in
the following:
14.2.1 Flat Transactions
A flat transaction consists of a set of operations on objects. For example, Amy has to travel
to Stuttgart from Cedar Rapids, so she books flights in the following three sectors: Cedar
Rapids to Chicago, Chicago to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Stuttgart. These three bookings
collectively constitute a flat transaction (Figure 14.1a). No operation on the objects of a flat
transaction is itself a transaction.

14.2.2 Nested Transactions
A nested transaction is an extension of the transaction model. It allows a transaction to contain
other transactions. For example, in Figure 14.1a, the trip from Frankfurt to Stuttgart can itself
be a transaction, if this trip is composed of a number of shorter train rides. Clearly, a nested
transaction has a multilevel tree structure. The nonroot transactions are called subtransactions.
As another example, note that many airlines offer the vacationers hotel accommodation
and automobile reservation along with flight reservation. Here, the top-level transaction vacation
is a nested transaction that consists of three subtransactions (Figure 14.1b):
• A flight from Cedar Rapids to San Francisco and back
• A hotel room in San Francisco for 2 days
• A car in San Francisco for 2 days
Such extensions of the transaction model are useful in the following way: It may be the case
that the flights and the hotel room are available, but not the car—so the last subtransaction
will abort. In such cases, instead of aborting the entire transaction, the main transaction
may (1) look for alternative modes of sightseeing (like contracting a tour company) or
(2) observe that the car is not available, but still commit the top-level transaction with the
information about possible alternative choices and hope that the availability of the transport
can be sorted out later.
Subtransactions can commit and abort independently, and these decisions can be taken
concurrently. In case two subtransactions access a shared object, the executions will be
serialized.
14.2.3 Distributed Transactions
Some transactions involve a single server, whereas others involve objects managed by multiple
servers. When the objects of a transaction are distributed over a set of distinct servers,
the transaction is called a distributed transaction. A distributed transaction can be either
flat or nested. Amy’s money transfer in the introductory section illustrates a flat distributed
transaction.
14.3 IMPLEMENTING TRANSACTIONS
Transaction processing may be centralized or distributed. In centralized transaction
processing,
a single transaction manager (TM) manages all operations. We outline two
different methods of implementing such transactions. One implementation uses a private
workspace for each transaction. The method consists of the following steps:
1. At the beginning, allocate the transaction a private workspace, and copy all files or
objects that it needs.
2. Read/write data from the files or carry out appropriate operation on the objects. Note
that changes will take place in the private workspace only.
300 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
3. If all operations are successfully completed, then commit the transaction by writing
the updates into the permanent record. Otherwise, the transaction will abort,
which is implemented by not writing the updates. The original state will remain
unchanged.
Another method of implementing transactions uses a write-ahead log. A write-ahead log
records the current state of the transaction before it updates the objects. The content of
the log is
(Transaction id, disk block number, old value, new value)
By assumption, these logs are not susceptible to failures. If the transaction commits, then
the log is discarded. On the other hand, if the transaction aborts, then the log is used
to undo the changes and restore the database to a consistent state. The log can also be
used to rerun the transaction after a failure.
The implementation of distributed transactions is much more tricky. Here, each computer
has a local TM, and these TMs interact with the data managers that are geographically
distributed
(Figure 14.2). The problem of atomic commitment becomes challenging when
one TM fails but the others continue to work as usual. Thus, in a transaction (x ≔ x − 100;
y ≔ y + 100) where x and y belong to different databases, if the TM crashes after completing
the operation x ≔ x − 100, then the database becomes inconsistent.

14.4 CONCURRENCY CONTROL AND SERIALIZABILITY
The goal of concurrency control is to guarantee that when multiple transactions are concurrently
executed, the net effect is equivalent to executing them in some serial order. This
is the essence of the serializability property.
Concurrent transactions dealing with disjoint objects are trivially serializable. However,
when objects are shared among concurrent transactions, an arbitrary interleaving of the
operations may not satisfy the serializability property. The consistency properties can be
violated in several ways, two of which are illustrated here.
Lost update problem: Amy and Bob have a joint account in a bank. Each of them
independently
deposits a sum of $250 to their joint account. Let the initial balance in
the account be B = $1000. After the two updates, the final balance should be $1500. Each
deposit is a transaction that consists of a sequence of three operations as shown in the
following:
No. Amy’s Transaction No. Bob’s Transaction
1 local ← B 4 local ← B
2 local ← local + $250 5 local ← local + $250
3 B ← local 6 B ← local
The final value of B will very much depend on how these operations are interleaved. When
the interleaving order is (1 2 3 4 5 6) or (4 5 6 1 2 3), the final value of B becomes $1500.
However, if the interleaving order is (1 4 2 5 3 6) or (1 2 4 5 6 3), then the final value
will be only $1250! What happened to the other deposit? This is the essence of the lost
update problem.
Serializability can be satisfied by properly scheduling the conflicting operations. The
operations on a shared object are either read or write. Two operations on a shared object
are said to be conflicting, when at least one of them is a write operation. In the example of
Amy or Bob’s transactions, B is the shared object and (3, 4), (1, 6), or (3, 6) are conflicting
operations. The improper scheduling of these operations can be avoided via locking (as in
two-phase locking [2PL]) or by time stamp ordering.
Dirty read problem: Even when serializability property is satisfied, the abortion of a
transaction can lead to sticky situations. For example, suppose the operations in Amy
and Bob’s transactions are scheduled as (1 2 3 4 5 6), which is a correct schedule satisfying
the serializability criterion. Consider the scenario in which first Amy’s transaction
aborts and then Bob’s transaction commits. The balance B will still be set to $1500,
although it should have been set to only $1250. The cause of the anomaly is that Bob’s
transaction read a value of B (updated by step 3) before Amy’s transaction decided to
abort. This is called the dirty read problem.
302 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Premature write problem: As another example of a problem situation caused by the
abortion
of a transaction, consider a shared variable B whose initial value is 0, and there
are two concurrent transactions T1 ≡ B ← 500 and T2 ≡ B ← 1000. Depending on the order
in which the two transactions complete, we will expect that B will be set to either 500 or
1000. Assume that they are executed in the order (T1; T2). Let T2 commit first (raising the
balance B to 1000), but T1 abort thereafter (changing the value of B to 0). Clearly, this is
not acceptable. This problem is called the premature write problem. The problem could be
avoided, if T2 delayed the writing of B until T1’s decision to commit or abort was taken. If
the earlier transaction aborts, then the later transaction must also abort. To avoid dirty
reads and premature writes, a transaction must delay its read or write operations until the
transactions scheduled earlier either commit or abort.
14.4.1 Testing for Serializability
Concurrent transactions commonly use locks with conflicting operations on shared
objects. One method of testing whether a schedule of concurrent transactions satisfies
the serializability property is to create a serialization graph. The serialization graph is a
directed graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of transactions and E is the set of directed
edges between transactions: a directed edge (Tj → Tk) implies that transaction Tk acquired
a lock only after transaction Tj released that lock. The following theorem tests the serializability
property:
Theorem 14.1
For a schedule of concurrent transactions, the serializability property holds if and only if
the corresponding serialization graph is acyclic.
For a proof of this theorem, see [BHG87].
14.4.2 Two-Phase Locking
Prior to performing an operation on an object, a transaction will request for a lock for that
object. A transaction will be granted an exclusive lock for all the objects that it will use.
Other transactions using one or more of these objects will wait until the previous transaction
releases the lock. In the case of Amy or Bob, the locks will be acquired and released
as follows:
lock B
local ← B
local ← local + $250
B ← local
unlock B
Accordingly, the only two feasible schedules are (1 2 3 4 5 6) and (4 5 6 1 2 3), which satisfy
the serializability property.
Distributed Transactions ◾ 303
The previous example is in a sense trivial, since only one lock is involved and atomicity
of the transaction implies serializability. To implement serializability with multiple objects
and multiple locks, a widely used method is 2PL. Two-phase locking guarantees that all
pairs of conflicting operations on shared objects by concurrent transactions are always
executed in the same order. The two phases are as follows:
Phase 1: The scheduler acquires all locks one after another without releasing any lock.
This is called the growing phase or acquisition phase.
Phase 2: The scheduler releases all locks acquired so far without acquiring any new lock.
This is called the shrinking phase or the release phase.
Two-phase locking prevents a transaction from acquiring any new lock after it has released
a lock, until all locks have been released. Locking can be fine grained. For example, there
can be separate read locks or write locks for an object. A read operation does not conflict
with another read operation, so the data manager can grant multiple read locks for the
same shared data. Only in the case of conflicts, the requesting transaction has to wait for
the lock.
The actions of the two phases alone do not rule out the occurrence of deadlocks. Here
is a simple example of how deadlock can occur. Suppose there are two transactions T1 and
T2, each needs to acquire the locks on objects x and y. Let T1 acquire the lock on x and T2
acquire the lock on y. Since each will now try to acquire the other lock and no transaction
will release a lock until its operation is completed, both will wait forever resulting in a
deadlock. However, a sufficient condition for avoiding deadlocks is to require all transactions
to acquire the required locks in the same global order—this avoids circular waiting.
This completes the final requirement of 2PL.
Theorem 14.2
Two-phase locking guarantees serializability.
Proof (by contradiction): Assume that the statement is not true. From Theorem 14.1, it
follows that the serialization graph must contain a cycle
Ti Tj Tk  Tm Ti     
This implies that Ti must have released a lock (that was later acquired by Tj) and then
acquired a lock (released by Tm). However, this violates the condition of 2PL that rules out
acquiring any lock after a lock has been released. ◾
304 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
14.4.3 Concurrency Control via Time Stamp Ordering
A different approach to concurrency control avoids any form of locking and relies solely
on time stamps. Each transaction Ti is assigned a time stamp TS(i) when it starts, and
the same time stamp TS(i) is assigned to all read and write accesses of every object x
by Ti. Time stamp ordering makes an a priori selection of the serialization order and
forces the transaction execution to obey that order. In particular, conflicting operations
on a shared variable x will be granted read or write access only if it comes in time stamp
order—otherwise, the access will be denied, and the transaction will abort and restart
at a later time with a new time stamp. There are several different versions of scheduling
reads and writes based on time stamps—here, we only discuss the basic version of time
stamp ordering.
Time stamp ordering assigns two time stamps RTS and WTS to each object x—their
values are determined by the time stamps of the transactions performing read or write
on x. Let RTS(x) be the largest time stamp of any transaction that reads x and WTS(x)
be the largest time stamp of any transaction that updates x. Now, if a transaction Tj
requests access to x, then the time stamp ordering protocol will handle the request as
follows:
{Transaction Tj wants to read x}
if TS(j) ≥ WTS(x) → allow read; RTS(x) ≔ max(RTS(x),TS(j))
[]TS(j) < WTS(x) → deny read {transaction aborts}
fi
{Transaction Tj wants to write x}
if TS(j) ≥ max(WTS(x),RTS(x)) → allow write; WTS(x) ≔ max
(WTS(x), TS(j))
[]TS(j) < max(WTS(x),RTS(x)) → deny write {transaction aborts}
fi {After a transaction aborts, it restarts with a new larger
time stamp.}
Consider the examples in Figure 14.3, where there are three concurrent transactions T1, T2,
and T3. In Figure 14.3a, all transactions will commit without any problem. In Figure 14.3b,
both T1 and T2 will abort—the schedulers will not schedule their r[x] operations since the
largest WTS is 50, which is greater than the time stamps of the transactions T1 and T2. If
these reads were scheduled, then they would have returned a value different from what
T1 or T2 wrote and thus violate atomicity. In Figure 14.3c, once again, both T1 and T2 will
abort, but for a different reason, the schedulers will not schedule their w[x] operations since
the largest WTS is 50. These writes, if scheduled, would have affected the outcome of the
r[x] by T3.
14.5 ATOMIC COMMIT PROTOCOLS
A distributed transaction deals with data from multiple servers. Each server completes a
subset of the operations belonging to the transactions. At the end, for each transaction,
all servers must agree to a final irrevocable decision regardless of crash or omission
Distributed Transactions ◾ 305
failures—the final decision must be either commit or abort. An atomic commit protocol
solves a variation of the consensus problem (Chapter 13) with the following specifications:
Termination: All nonfaulty servers must eventually reach an irrevocable decision.
Agreement: If any server decides to commit, then every server must have voted to commit.
Validity: If all servers vote commit and there is no failure, then all servers must commit.
The agreement property implies that all servers reach the same decision. In the classic
consensus problem, if some servers vote commit but others vote abort, then the final

306 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
irrevocable decision could have been commit—however, here, the agreement clause of the
atomic commit problem rules out this possibility. We now look into the implementation of
atomic commit protocols.
14.5.1 One-Phase Commit
In implementing atomic commit protocols, one of the servers is chosen as the coordinator.
A client sends a request to open a transaction to an accessible server. This server
becomes the coordinator for that transaction. Other servers involved in this transaction
are called participants. The coordinator will assign relevant components of this
transaction to its participants and ask them to commit when they are done. This is
the essence of one-phase commit protocol. It is expected that the participants will be
able to complete the tasks assigned to them. If due to local problems (like failure or
concurrency control conflict) some participants are unable to commit, then neither
the coordinator nor other participants will know about this (since everything has to
be completed in a single phase), and atomicity will be violated. So each participant
has to assume the responsibility for local failure recovery. This is a somewhat naive
approach for implementing atomic transactions. A much more pragmatic approach is
the two-
phase commit
(2PC) protocol.
14.5.2 Two-Phase Commit
2PC protocols (Figure 14.4a) overcome the limitations of one-phase commit protocol.
The two phases of the protocol are as follows:
Phase 1: The coordinator sends out a PREPARE message to each participant, asking
them to respond whether they are ready to commit (by voting yes) or prefer
to abort (by voting no). When the participants respond, the coordinator collects
their votes.

Distributed Transactions ◾ 307
Phase 2: If all servers vote yes at the end of phase 1, then in phase 2, the coordinator
will send a COMMIT message to all participants. Otherwise, if at least one server
votes no, then the coordinator will send out an ABORT message to all participants.
Each participant
sending a yes vote waits to receive an ABORT or a COMMIT message
from the coordinator and takes appropriate actions thereafter. The steps are as follows:
program 2PC
{program for the coordinator}
{Phase 1: prepare}
Send PREPARE to all participants;
Wait to receive the vote (yes or no) from each participant
{Phase 2: commit}
if ∀participant j: vote(j) = yes → multicast COMMIT to all
participants
[] ∃ participant j: vote (j) = no → multicast ABORT to all
participants
fi
{program for each participant}
if {Phase 1} message from coordinator = PREPARE → send yes or no
[] {Phase 2} message from coordinator = COMMIT → commit local actions
[] {Phase 2} message from coordinator = ABORT → abort local actions
fi
In phase 2, if the coordinator sends a COMMIT message, then each participant updates
its local log, releases all locks, and sends a DONE message to the coordinator. After the
coordinator receives DONE messages from all participants, it writes the complete record
into its log and deletes the record from its volatile store.
Failure handling: The basic two-phase protocol may run into difficult situations when failures
occur. A server may fail by crashing and thus may fail to respond. Also, messages may
be lost. This makes the implementation of the 2PC protocol nontrivial. In a purely asynchronous
environment, when the coordinator or a participant is blocked while waiting
for a message, it cannot figure out if the sender crashed or the message is lost or delayed.
Although time-out is used to detect message losses and process failures, it is not foolproof.
Therefore, in case of any doubt, the system should ideally revert to a fail-safe configuration
by aborting all transactions.
Some specific failure scenarios and their remedies are summarized
as follows:
Case 1: (Phase 1) The coordinator times out waiting for a vote message from a participant.
To deal with possible message loss, the coordinator may send the PREPARE
message a bounded number of times. If there is no response, then the coordinator
decides to abort the transaction and sends ABORT to all.
Case 2: (Phase 2) A participant times out waiting for a COMMIT or an ABORT message
from the coordinator. The participant has no knowledge of the coordinator’s
308 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
decision,
so it cannot unilaterally decide since that may violate the atomicity. The
participant remains blocked while sending a get status message to the coordinator
asking for its decision. When the coordinator receives such a message, it checks
if a record exists in its volatile memory and replies accordingly. Otherwise, it
sends an ABORT to the participant. However, if the coordinator crashes, then the
participant remains undecided until the coordinator recovers from the failure.
It has no clue if other participants received a COMMIT or an ABORT message
before the coordinator crashed. So, for an indefinite period, resources may remain
locked, affecting other transactions. One possible solution for the blocked participant
is to query a nonfaulty participant: What message
(COMMIT or ABORT) did
you get from the coordinator? If the answer is COMMIT, then the participant will
commit its local transaction; otherwise, it will abort.
But now consider the more difficult case of multiple server failures as described
in the following:
Case 3: (Phase 2) Consider the case when both the coordinator and a participant
have crashed (Figure 14.4b), but a second participant has voted yes in phase 1 and
is waiting for a commit or an abort message in phase 2 from the coordinator. If
one of the crashed participants decided to abort, then the second participant must
abort. On the other hand, if the crashed participant decided to commit before
the crash, then the second participant must commit. With these two conflicting
possibilities, the second participant has little choice but to wait, until the crashed
servers recover.
The previous situation may be rare, but it reflects that 2PC is a blocking protocol:
the operational
servers may sometimes have to wait indefinitely on the recovery of
a failed server. Locks must be held on the database while the transaction is blocked.
To improve failure
handling, Skeen and Stonebraker [SkS83] proposed three-phase
commit
(3PC) protocol.
It is a nonblocking protocol. An atomic commitment protocol
is called nonblocking,
if in spite of crashes, every nonfaulty server eventually
decides—this implies that the operational servers will not block until the recovery of
the failed servers.
14.5.3 Three-Phase Commit
The 3PC protocol removes the uncertainty in the two-phase protocol caused by the failures
of the coordinator and a participant. Phase 1 is similar to that in 2PC: A time-out in this
phase will prompt the coordinator to abort of the transaction. Phase 2, the precommit phase,
is the new addition. This phase is meant to remove the uncertainty period for participants
that have committed and are waiting for the final commit or abort message from the
coordinator.
If a precommit message is not received, then the participant will abort and
release any blocked resources. When receiving a precommit message, participants
know
that all others have voted to commit. After this, even if the coordinator crashes or times
out, the participant goes forward with the commit.

14.6 RECOVERY FROM FAILURES
Atomic commit protocols enable transactions to tolerate server crashes or omission failures,
so that the system remains in a consistent state. However, to make transactions durable, we
would expect servers to be equipped with incorruptible memory. A random access memory
(RAM) loses its content when there is a power failure. An ordinary disk may crash,
and thus, its contents may be lost forever—so it is unsuitable for archival storage.
A form of
archival memory that can survive all single failures is known as a stable storage, introduced
by Butler Lampson.
14.6.1 Stable Storage
A stable storage can be implemented using a pair of ordinary disks. Let A be a composite
object with components A0, A1, A2, …, An−1. Consider a transaction that assigns a new value
xi to each component Ai. We will represent this by A ≔ x. This transaction is atomic, when
either all assignments Ai ≔ xi are completed or no assignment takes effect. Ordinarily, a
crash failure of the updating process will potentially allow a fraction of these assignments
to be completed and violate the atomicity property.
The stable storage maintains two copies* of the object A (i.e., two copies of each
component
Ai) and allows two operations update and inspect on A. Designate these two
* The technique is called mirroring and is used in RAID1 disk systems.
310 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
copies by A0 and A1 (Figure 14.5). When a process P performs the update operation, it
updates the two copies alternately and stamps these updates with (1) the time stamp T and
(2) a unique signature S called checksum, which is a function of x and T.
A fail-stop failure can halt the update operation after any step. Process Q, which performs
the inspect operation, checks both copies and, based on the times of updates as well as the
values of the checksums, chooses the correct version of A.
{procedure update}
1 A0 ≔ x; {copy 0 updated}
2 T0 ≔ timestamp; {timestamp assigned to copy 0}
3 S0 ≔ checksum(x,T0); {signature assigned to copy 0}
4 A1 ≔ x; {copy 1 updated}
5 T1 ≔ timestamp; {timestamp assigned to copy 1}
6 S1 ≔ checksum(x,T1) {signature assigned to copy 1}
{procedure inspect}
[a] if S0 = checksum(A0,T0) ∧ S1 = checksum(A1,T1) ∧ T0 > T1 → accept A0
[b] [] S0 = checksum(A0,T0) ∧ S1 = checksum(A1,T1) ∧ T0 < T1 → accept any
[c] [] S0 = checksum(A0,T0) ∧ S1 ≠ checksum(A1,T1) → accept A0
[d] [] S0 ≠ checksum(A0,T0) ∧ S1 = checksum(A1,T1) → accept A1
fi
Case [a] corresponds to a possible failure between steps 3 and 4 of an update. Case [b]
represents
no failure—so any one of the copies is acceptable. Case [c] indicates a failure
between steps 4 and 6, and case [d] indicates a failure between steps 1 and 3. As long as
the updating process fails by stopping at any point during steps 1–6 of the update operation,
one of the guards A–D becomes true for process Q. The application must be able to
continue
regardless of whether the old or in the new state is returned.
The two copies A0 and A1 are stored on two disks mounted on separate drives. Data can
also be recovered when instead of a process crash one of the two disks crashes. Additional
robustness can be added to the previous design by using extra disks.

14.6.2 Checkpointing and Rollback Recovery
Consider a distributed transaction and assume that each process has access to a stable
storage to record its local state. Failures may hit one or more processes, making the global
state inconsistent. Checkpointing is a mechanism that enables transactions to recover from
such inconsistent configurations using backward error recovery. When a transaction is
in progress, the states of the participating servers are periodically recorded on the local
stable storages. These fragments collectively define a checkpoint. Following the detection
of a failure, the system state rolls back to the most recent checkpoint, which completes the
recovery. The technique is not limited to transactions only, but is applicable in general to
all message-passing distributed systems.
In a simple form of checkpointing, each process has the autonomy to decide when to
record checkpoints. This is called independent or uncoordinated checkpointing. For example,
a process may decide to record a checkpoint when the information to be saved is small, since
this will conserve storage. However, a collection of unsynchronized snapshots may not represent
a meaningful or consistent global state (see Chapter 8). To restore the system to a consistent
global state, intelligent rollback is necessary. If the nearest checkpoint does not reflect
a consistent global state, then rollback must continue until a consistent checkpoint is found.
In some cases, it may trigger a domino effect. We illustrate the problem through an example.
In Figure 14.6, three processes P, Q, and R communicate with one another via message
passing. Let each process spontaneously record three checkpoints for possible rollback—
these are marked with bold circles. Now, assume that process R failed after sending its last
message m7. So its state will roll back to r2. Since the sending of the message by R is nullified,
its reception of m7 by Q also must be nullified, and the state of Q will roll back to q2.
This will nullify the sending of the last message m5 by Q to P, and therefore, the state of P
has to roll back to p2.
But the rollbacks do not end here. Observe that (p2, q2, r2) does not represent a consistent
global state. Process R has to undo the sending of its previous message m6, and its local
state now has to revert to r1. This will cause Q to revert its state to q1. Eventually, the
processes have to roll back all the way to their initial checkpoints (p0, q0, r0), which by

FIGURE 14.6 An example of domino effect in uncoordinated checkpointing: The dark circles represent
the local states of processes saved on stable storage. If R crashes after sending its last message
m7 to Q, then the global state of the system will eventually roll back to (p0, q0, r0).
312 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
definition is a valid checkpoint (since no messages were exchanged before it). So the entire
computation is lost despite all the space used to record the nine checkpoints. If process P
recorded its last checkpoint after sending the last message, then the computation could
have rolled back only to (p2, q2, r2). This would have been possible with coordinated checkpointing.
Coordinated checkpoints can be recorded using Chandy–Misra’s distributed
snapshot algorithm (when the channels are FIFO) or Lai–Yang’s algorithm (when the FIFO
guarantee of channels does not exist) (see Chapter 8).
There are some computations that communicate with the outside world and cannot
be reversed during a rollback. A printer that has printed a document cannot be asked to
reverse its action for the sake of failure recovery, nor can an ATM machine that has dispensed
some cash to a customer be expected to retrieve the cash from a customer. In such
cases, logging is used to replay the computation. All messages received from the environment
are logged before use, and all messages sent to the environment are logged before
they are sent out. During a replay, these logged messages are used to substitute the interaction
with the outside world.
14.6.3 Message Logging
Message logging is a general technique for improving the efficiency of checkpoint-based
recovery following crash failures. Checkpointing involves writing a complete set of states
on the stable storage, and frequent checkpointing slows down the normal progress of the
computation. For coordinated checkpointing, add to that the overhead of synchronizing
the recording instants. On the other hand, infrequent checkpointing may cause significant
amount of rollback when failures occur, which adds to the cost of recovery. Message logging
helps us strike a middle ground—even if the checkpointing is infrequent, starting
from a
consistent checkpoint P, a more recent recovery point Q can be reconstructed by replaying
the logged messages in the same order in which they were delivered before the crash.
Either the sender or the receiver can log messages into a stable storage. Logging takes
time, so whether a process should wait for the completion of the logging of messages before
delivering it to the application is an important design decision. All message-logging protocols
have a common goal: Once a crashed process recovers, its state is consistent with
the states of the other processes. Surviving processes whose states are inconsistent with
those of other process are known as orphan processes. Inadequate message logging can lead
to the creation of orphan processes. Message-logging protocols must guarantee that upon
recovery, no process remains an orphan.
Figure 14.7 illustrates three messages exchanged among the processes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Assume that m1 and m3 were logged (into the stable storage) by the receiving processes, but
m2 was not. If the receiver of the message m2 (i.e., process 0) crashes and later recovers, the
state of the system can be reconstructed up to the point when m1 was received. Neither m2
nor m3 (which is causally ordered after m2) can be correctly replayed. However, process
3
already received message m3. Since the sending of m3 cannot be replayed using the log,
process 3 becomes an orphan process.
Note that, if process 1 or 0 logged m2 before the crash, then that could prevent 3 from
being an orphan. In general, for any given message, let depend(m) be the set of processes that
Distributed Transactions ◾ 313
(1) delivered m or (2) delivered a message m′ such that m ≺ m′. The reconstruction of the
computation of every process in depend(m) will depend on the ability to replay m. Define
copy(m) to be the set of processes that sent or received m, but did not log it. In Figure 14.5,
depend(m2) = {0, 1, 3} and copy(m2) = {0, 1}. If every process in copy(m) crashes, then the
transmission of m cannot be replayed. As a result, every process j ∈ depend(m)\copy(m)
becomes an orphan.
There are two versions of logging that deal with this. In the pessimistic protocol, each
process delivers a message only after every message delivered before it has been logged.
Optimistic protocols cut down on the logging overhead by taking some risk that improves
the speed during failure-free runs. When a failure occurs, the protocol determines if there
are orphans, and the system rolls back to make the state consistent.
Many computations in a distributed system are nondeterministic. Two different runs of
the system may lead to two different global states both of which are consistent. The order
of arrival of the messages may vary from one run to another. In the recovery of nondeterministic
computations using message logging, the replayed messages simply reflect the last
run. It does not lead to any new nondeterminism other than whatever was present in the
original system prior to the crash.
14.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Time stamp ordering and 2PL are two different techniques for concurrency control,
and these work differently. In 2PL, transactions wait for locks from time to time, but do
not abort and restart unless a deadlock occurs. In time stamp ordering, deadlock is not
possible.
An optimistic version of time stamp ordering thrives on the observation that
conflicts are rare, so all transactions run without restrictions. Each transaction keeps
track of its own reads and writes. Prior to committing, each transaction checks if those
values have been changed (by some other transaction). If not, then the transaction commits;
otherwise, it aborts.
For distributed commit, the 2PC protocol has been extremely popular, although the basic
version is prone to blocking when the coordinator crashes. The 3PC, originally proposed
by Skeen [S83], resolves the blocking problem, but its implementation involves additional

states and extra messages. Another solution is the nonblocking 2PC by Babaõglu and Toueg
[BT93], which is technically sound but the additional message complexity is unavoidable.
None of these two improvisations seem to be very much in use, since blocking due to the
crash of the coordinator is rare. Distributed systems with communication failures do not
have nonblocking solutions to the atomic commit problem.
Checkpointing is widely used for transaction recovery. The frequent writing of global
states on the stable storage tends to slow down the computation speed. A combination of
infrequent checkpointing and message logging prevents massive rollbacks and potentially
improves performance.
14.8 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Härder and Reuter [HR83] coined the phrase ACID properties. Papadimitriou [P79] formally
introduced the serializability property to characterize the logical isolation of concurrent
transactions. Bernstein et al.’s book [BGH87] describes many important methods of concurrency
control. Eswaran et al. [EGT76] proved that 2PL satisfies serializability. Gray and
Reuter [GR93] discussed the time stamp ordering protocol for serializable transactions.
Kung and Robinson [KR81] described several optimistic versions of concurrency control.
The 2PC protocol is due to Gray [G78]. The blocking properties of this protocol are also
discussed in [BGH87]. Skeen [S83] introduced the 3PC protocol.
Lampson et al. [LPS81] introduced the idea of stable storage and suggested an implementation
of it. Randell [R75] wrote an early paper on designing fault-tolerant system by
checkpointing. Strom and Yemini [SY85] studied optimistic recovery methods. Elnozahy
et al.’s paper [EJZ92] contains a good survey of checkpointing and logging methods. Alvisi
and Marzullo [AM98] described various message-logging methods and orphan elimination
techniques.

transaction aborts and later restarts with a new time stamp. Consider three transactions,
T1, T2, and T3, in a concurrent run. Is it possible to have a scenario where every
transaction periodically aborts and then restarts, and this behavior continues forever?
In other words, how can you prove time stamp ordering guarantees termination?

this: There are n (n > 1) servers; each server manages m objects (m > 1). Each server

this sufficient for serializability? Is this sufficient to avoid deadlocks? Explain.

Simulate this transaction using the 2PC protocol. Include a 5% possibility of
server crashes. To simulate the crash, each server will randomly pick a number
between 1 and 20. If the random value <20, then the server provides the normal
response. If the random value = 20, then the server stops responding, which mimics
a crash.

Group Communication
15.1 INTRODUCTION
A group is a collection of users or objects sharing a common interest or working toward
a common goal. With the rapid growth of the WWW and electronic commerce, grouporiented
activities have substantially increased in recent years. Examples of groups are as
follows: (1) the batch of students who graduated from a high school in a given year, (2) the
members of a particular travel club, (3) the students of a long-distance education course,
(4) the members participating in a videoconference, (5) a set of replicated servers forming
a highly available service, etc.
Groups may be classified into various types. One classification is based on whether the
composition of members is fixed or variable. A group is called closed, when its membership
remains unchanged. An example is the batch of students who graduated from the Sleepy
Hollow High School in the year 2014. The other type of group, in which the membership
changes from time to time, is called open. The members of the travel club Himalayan
Hikers form an open group since the existing members can leave the group, and new members
can join at any time. Another classification is based on the nature of communication:
A group is called a peer-to-peer group when all members have equal rights and privileges
in the group and members communicate with their peers to sustain the group activities.
An example of an activity is the maintenance of an electronic bulletin board by the graduating
students of the class of 2014 from a high school—any member could post items of
common interest to be viewed by every other member of the group. In contrast, a group
is called a hierarchical group, where one member is distinguished from the rest, and typically
communication takes place between this distinguished member and the rest of the
group. A stockbroker communicating with his clients forms a hierarchical group. Note
that a hierarchical group can have multiple levels—the president of a company may want
to communicate with the managers only, and each manager may communicate with the
employees belonging to his or her team.
318 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The members of a group communicate with one another using some form of multicast*
that is restricted to the members of that group. A message sent by any member of a group
must be received by every member of that group or by none at all. This atomicity property
is at the heart of group communication—but there are other issues too. These include
communication complexity, the ability to tolerate various kinds of failures, and network
partition tolerance. Furthermore, when group membership changes in a planned or an
unplanned way, certain guarantees must hold to preserve the integrity of group services.
We will elaborate these issues later.
15.2 ATOMIC MULTICAST
A multicast in a group is called atomic, when the message is received either by every nonfaulty
(i.e., functioning) member or by no member at all. Atomic multicast is a basic requirement
of all group-oriented activities. Cases where some nonfaulty members receive a particular
message but others do not lead to inconsistent update of the states of the members and are
not acceptable. For example, consider a group of people forming a travel club. If a multicast
about a special travel opportunity for the coming Christmas season is sent out, then every
member of the travel club should receive it. Another example is a group of replicated servers.
If the primary server fails, then a backup server is expected to take over. For this to happen,
the states of all servers must be identical to that of the primary server before the failure
occurred (via the multicasts from the primary server). However, this will not be possible if
one or more backup servers fail to receive some of the updates from the primary server.
Clearly, failures play a prominent role in the implementation of atomic multicast.
Accordingly, we will consider two broad classes of atomic multicasts: basic and reliable.
Basic multicast rules out process crashes (or does not provide any guarantee when processes
crash), whereas reliable multicasts take process crash into account and provide
guarantees. If failures are ruled out, then every basic multicast is trivially atomic. Reliable
atomic multicasts should satisfy the following three properties:
Validity: If a correct process multicasts a message m, then it eventually delivers m.
Agreement: If a correct process delivers m, then all correct processes eventually deliver m.
Integrity: Every correct process delivers a message m at most once, only if some process
in the group multicasts that message. The reception of spurious messages is ruled out.
The delivery of a message affects the state of the recipient and the application supported by
it. Note that agreement does not follow from validity or vice versa—a correct process may
start a multicast operation as a sequence of point-to-point communications and then crash.
We first address basic multicasts. At the data link layer, shared media like Ethernet LAN
provide a natural support for multicast. In wireless networks, if each member is within the
broadcast signal range from every other member, then every process receives the messages
that are sent out. Hosts deliver only those messages that are addressed to them.

15.3 IP MULTICAST
IP multicast is a popular technique for multicasting at the network layer. It is a bandwidthconserving
technology that reduces traffic by simultaneously delivering a single stream
of information to multiple clients. This is particularly suitable for large-scale applications—
examples include distance learning, videoconferencing, and the distribution of
software, stock quotes, and news. The source sends only one copy, which is replicated by
the routers.
An arbitrary set of clients forms a group before receiving the multicast. The Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned class D IP addresses for IP multicast.
This means that all IP multicast group addresses belong to the range of 224.0.0.0 to
239.255.255.255. The multicast group address serves as a virtual channel. Group members
select the channel by selecting the appropriate address, and the network configures itself to
deliver the multicast traffic to the group members. The data are distributed via a distribution
tree. Members of groups can join or leave at any time, so the distribution trees must
be dynamically updated. When all active receivers connected to a particular edge of the
distribution tree leave the multicast group, the routers prune that edge from the distribution
tree (i.e., stop forwarding traffic down that edge). If some receiver connected to that
edge becomes active again and resume their participation, then the router modifies the
distribution tree and starts forwarding traffic again.
Two widely used forms of distribution trees are source trees and shared trees. A source
tree is a shortest path tree rooted at the source. Figure 15.1a shows a source tree where a
host connected to router B is the source. For a different source, the tree will be different.
The source sends one copy to each neighboring router across the shortest path links. These
routers replicate it and forward a copy to each of their neighbors. The shortest path property
optimizes network latency and works well for streaming data. This optimization does
come with a price, though: The routers must maintain path information for each source.
In a network that has thousands of sources and thousands of groups, this quickly becomes
a resource issue for the routers.

the tree edges (a) a source tree rooted at B and (b) a shared tree with E as RP.
320 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
An alternative is to use shared trees. In a shared tree, a specific router is chosen as the
rendezvous point (RP), which becomes the root of all spanning trees used for multicasting
(Figure 15.1b). All routers must forward the group communication traffic from their local
hosts toward the (RP), which forwards them to the appropriate destinations via a common
shortest path tree rooted at the RP. The overall memory requirement for the routers
of a network that allows only shared trees is lower. The disadvantages of shared trees are
primarily twofold: (1) the load on the RP is large and (2) the paths between the source and
the destination nodes may not be optimal, introducing additional latency (notice the path
from B to F in Figure 15.1b where E is the RP).
15.3.1 Reverse Path Forwarding
In point-to-point communication, traffic from a source is routed through the network along
a unique path to the destination. Here, routers do not care about the source address—they
only care about the destination address. Each router looks up its routing table and forwards
a single copy of the packet toward a router in the direction of the destination.
In multicast routing, the source sends a packet to an arbitrary group of hosts identified
by a multicast group address. For each source, the multicast router must be able to distinguish
between upstream (toward the source) and downstream (away from the source)
links. If there are multiple downstream links, the router replicates the packet and forwards
the traffic down the appropriate downstream links—which is not necessarily all links. This
concept of forwarding multicast packets away from the source is called reverse path forwarding
(RPF).
The RPF algorithm that builds a shortest path tree is constructed for each source.
Whenever a router R receives a multicast packet from the source S on a link L, it checks to
see if the link L belongs to the shortest path from R to S (which is the reverse path back to
the source). If this is the case, then the packet is forwarded on all links except L. Otherwise,
the packet is discarded as a forged or a spurious packet or a redundant one (Figure 15.2).
This strategy helps avoid the formation of circular paths in the routes.
Multicast backbone (Mbone) is a popular multicast protocol to distribute audio and video
to group members over the Internet. Mbone first creates an overlay network implemented on
top of some portions of the Internet that includes the group members. An overlay network

FIGURE 15.2 An example of RPF with the source node S: The recipients discard the incoming
packets represented by the broken arrows.
Group Communication ◾ 321
is a logical network defined on top of the IP network—the nodes are islands of multicastcapable
subnetworks, and the logical links connecting the nodes are tunnels through which
multicast messages are forwarded via non-multicast-capable portions of the Internet. The
multicast routers have the ability to interpret the multicast command, but the unicast routers
are unable to do so—therefore, multicast packets are encapsulated inside unicast packets
and dispatched along the tunnels. The unicast routers simply forward these packets, but the
multicast routers interpret them and locally distribute them to the members of the group.
Each router performs an RPF check on each received packet to select only packets on the
interface that is the most efficient path back to the source. All other packets are discarded.
15.4 APPLICATION LAYER MULTICAST
While IP multicast is bandwidth efficient and many routers are equipped with the facility
of IP multicast, one significant impediment is the growing size of the state space that each
router has to maintain per group. The rapid growth of group-oriented activities is making
the problem worse. Application layer multicast is an alternative approach that overcomes
this problem.
Basic application layer multicast works on an overlay network connecting the members
of the group. Data or messages are replicated and managed at the end hosts instead
of the routers, and the routers are no more required to maintain group-specific states.
Application-level multicasts are implemented as a series of point-to-point messages. The
network only needs to provide the basic stateless, unicast, best-effort delivery. The downside
is an increase in the consumption of network resources like bandwidth, since the same
message may be routed multiple times across a link (the replication factor is known as
stress). Figure 15.3 shows an example. Here, host 0 multicasts a message to hosts 1, 2, and 3.
In Figure 15.3a, the same message is sent to router A three times (so the stress on the link is 3).
Figure 15.3b uses a different routing strategy (using the paths 0 A C 2 and 0 A B 1 B D 3),
which reduces the load on the link from 0 to A and A to B.
The basic scheme is sometimes called the P2P (peer-to-peer) scheme where only the
peers maintain group-specific information and manage the routing process. An alternative

322 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
is the overlay multicast scheme [AMM+04], where a number of strategically deployed
proxy nodes are used to back up the hosts. The content is distributed to these proxy servers
that are connected by an overlay network. Akamai [NSS10] uses this approach in their
content distribution network for video streaming, where surrogate servers maintain copies
of the content and thus maintain a better quality of service. Various other improvements
are feasible in the basic application layer multicast scheme. For example, using cross-layer
communication, hosts may collect information from the routers to improve the efficiency
of IP multicast by reducing packet duplication.
15.5 ORDERED MULTICASTS
In multicast groups, there are two orthogonal issues: reliability and order. Reliable multicast
addresses only the reliability issue by guaranteeing that each member receives every
message sent out by the other members in spite of process failures. So far, it is silent about
the order in which these messages are delivered. However, even in basic multicast, many
applications require a guarantee stronger than atomicity—here, the order of message delivery
becomes important. Even if the underlying communication is reliable, guaranteeing
the order of message delivery can be far from trivial. One such version requires all messages
to be delivered to every group member in the same total order. For example, a group
of replicated files cannot be in the same state unless all replicas apply the updates from
their users in the same order. Other applications may have a weaker ordering requirement.*
Guaranteeing ordered message delivery in the presence of process crashes (i.e., implementing
the reliable version of ordered multicast) is much more challenging than the basic versions.
In this chapter, we will primarily focus on the basic versions of ordered multicasts.
The following are the three main types or orderings that have been studied in the context
of ordered multicasts:
1. Local order multicast (also called single-source FIFO)
2. Causal order multicast
3. Total order multicast
Local order multicast: In local order multicast, if a process multicasts two messages in the
order (m1, m2), then every correct process in the group must deliver m1 before m2. There
are many applications of local order multicast: One is in the implementation of a DSM
where the primary copy of each variable is maintained by an exclusive process, and all
other processes use cached copies of it. Whenever the primary copy is updated, the owner
of the primary copy multicasts the updates to the holders of the cached copies, and these
copies are updated in the same order. Other applications include video distribution and
software distribution.
Causal order multicast: Let m1 and m2 be a pair of messages in a group, such that
sent(m1) ≺ sent(m2). Then causal order multicast requires that every process in the system
* Chapter 16 will discuss some of these applications.
Group Communication ◾ 323
must deliver m1 before m2. Local order multicast trivially satisfies this. Causal order
multicast
modifies it by imposing delivery orders among causally ordered messages from
distinct senders too. Here is an example: A group of students scattered across a large campus
are preparing for an upcoming quiz through a shared bulletin board. Someone comes
up with a question and throws it to the entire group, and whoever knows the answer multicasts
it to the entire group. The delivery of a question to each student must happen before
the delivery of the corresponding answer, since these are causally related. It will be awkward
(and a violation of the rules of causal ordered multicast) if some student receives the
answer first and then the corresponding question!
Total order multicast: In total order atomic multicast, every member of the group is required
to deliver all messages sent within the group in identical order. It implies that if every process
i maintains a queue Q · i (initially empty) to which a message is appended as soon as it
is delivered, then eventually, for any two distinct processes i and j, Q . i = Q . j. Note that the
order in which the messages are delivered has no connection with the real time at which
these messages were sent out.
The underlying abstract concept behind total order multicast is that of a replicated
state machine. Assume that each client sends its request to a group of identical servers, the
objective being that if one server crashes then another server will take over. The servers
have states, and each request from a client modifies the state of a server. For consistency,
it is essential that all nonfaulty servers remain in the same state after each update. This
cannot be met without total order multicast. Compared with causal order multicast, total
order multicast is more restrictive. However, the order in which messages will be delivered
in a total order multicast need not agree with the causal order.
In real-time environment, one more class of atomic multicast is relevant—it is called
timed multicast. A Δ-timed multicast is one in which every message sent at time t is delivered
to the each member at or before the time (t + Δ). If a message is not delivered to at
least one process within that time window, then it should not be delivered to any process
within that time window. The time may be maintained either by an external observer or by
the clocks local to the processes. Depending on the choice, different variations of the timed
multicasts can be defined.
In the presence of omission failures, local order reliable multicast can be implemented
using Stenning’s protocol or an appropriate window protocol (Chapter 12). So, we will only
discuss the implementation of the other two types of ordered multicasts. We focus only on
the basic versions.
15.5.1 Implementing Total Order Multicast
Several implementations of total order multicast exist. Here, we present two different
implementations.
15.5.1.1 Implementation Using a Sequencer
A designated member S of the group acts as a sequencer process [CM84]. It assigns a unique
sequence number seq to every message m that it receives and multicasts it to every other
324 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
member of that group. Each member first sends its message to the sequencer process.
The variable seq in the sequencer defines the order in which every member will accept the
messages. After receiving the multicast from the sequencer S, each member accepts the
messages in the ascending order of seq. Messages received out of order are buffered (assuming
that there is available space for it), until the message with the expected number arrives.
Essentially, the sequencer performs a local order multicast.
{The sequencer S}
define seq: integer {initially seq = 0}
do receive m → multicast (m, seq) to all members;
seq ≔ seq + 1;
deliver m
od
One criticism of this simple implementation is that the sequencer process becomes a
bottleneck. The next implementation illustrates a distributed version that does not use a
central process as a sequencer.
15.5.1.2 Distributed Implementation
For a distributed implementation of total order multicast, it is tempting to use the real
time of the individual multicasts for determining the total order. Thus, if three messages
m1, m2, m3 are multicast at times t1, t2, t3, respectively, and t1 < t2 < t3, then every
member of the group will deliver the messages in the order m1, m2, m3. The solution
is feasible in systems where message propagation delays are bounded. In asynchronous
system, message propagation delays can be arbitrarily large, so messages can reach their
destinations in any order. As a result, a process that first received m2 has no way of guessing
if another message m1 has been sent at an earlier time and is still in transit. This leads
to the following two-phase protocol for total order multicast, which is similar to the 2PC
protocol of Section 14.5.
Phase 1: To multicast a message m, a sender sends (m, ts) every member of the group,
where ts is the send time stamp of the message. Upon receiving it, a member saves it in
a holdback queue, assigns a receive time stamp ts′ to it, and sends an ack (a, ts′) back
to the sender.
Phase 2: After the sender receives (a, ts′) from every member in the group, it picks up
the largest value of ts′. Let ts″ be this value. Then it multicasts a commit message with
the time stamp ts″ to every member of the group. The recipients subsequently use the
value of ts″ to determine the delivery order of the messages in its holdback queue.
Figure 15.4 shows an example. Here, p receives three acks with time stamps 3, 4, and 10
from the members—so p multicasts a commit message with a time stamp 10 that is the
maximum of these values. Similarly, the commit messages from processes q and r have time
Group Communication ◾ 325
stamps 22 and 19, respectively. Therefore, every process will sequentially accept messages
from the senders in the order (p, r, q).
Why does it work? The argument is straightforward: Every process will eventually receive
all commit messages, and every process will eventually learn about the unique delivery order
from the values of ts. To guarantee liveness, let m · 1, m · 2, m · 3,… be the sequence of messages
currently in the holdback queue of a member p, sorted in the ascending order of the commit
times. To decide if a message m · i is ready for delivery, member p must ascertain that (1) all
messages up to m ⋅ (i−1) have been delivered and (2) no commit message with a time stamp ts
smaller than that of m · i will arrive in the future. Since the logical clocks of every member continue
to increase and every member learns about the values the logical clocks of its peers via
messages and acks, the second condition is guaranteed at a time when the minimum of all the
logical clocks exceeds the commit time of the message m · i, assuming each channel to be FIFO.
In the previous implementation, for each message multicast by a member, two additional
messages (ack and commit) are required. Therefore, to implement total order multicast
in a group of size n where each member sends one message, a total number of 3n2
messages will be required.
15.5.2 Implementing Causal Order Multicast
The implementation of causal order multicast uses vector time stamps (introduced in Chapter 6),
with a minor modification.* In a group of n members 0, 1, 2,…, (n−1), a vector
clock VC is a
nonnegative integer vector of length n. The vector clock is event driven. Let VC[i] denote the
current value of the local vector clock of member i and T[j] denote the vector time stamp associated
with the incoming message sent by member j. Also, let VCk[i] represent the kth element of
the vector clock VC[i]. To multicast a message, a member i will increment VCi[i] and append the
updated VC[i] to the message. If the recipient j decides to accept the message, there it updates
VC[j] as follows: ∀k: VCk[j] := max(Tk[i], VCk[j]). To decide whether to accept this message,
the recipient has to decide the causal order of this message with respect to other messages. In
Figure 15.5, send(m1)≺send(m2) so P2 should deliver these messages in that order. But m2 from
P1 arrived at P2 earlier than m1, so P2 must delay the delivery of m2 until m1 from P0 arrives
(and P2 delivers it). But the important question is how will P2 decide that it cannot deliver m2
* The vector time stamp scheme is often fine-tuned to satisfy specific requirements.

as soon as it receives m2—it has no knowledge that m1 will arrive in the future? The following
two observations form the basis of member i’s decision to deliver a message from process j:
Observation 1: Member i must have received and delivered all previous messages sent by
member j. So Tj[j] = VCj[i] + 1.
Observation 2: For every other member k(k ≠ j), member i must also have received all
messages sent by k, which were received by member j before it sent the current message.
This means ∀k ≠ j:Tk[j] ≤ VCk[i].
We now revisit Figure 15.5 and focus on the message m2 from process P1 to process P2.
Here, T[1]=1,1,0 and VC[2]=0,0,0. So the first requirement is satisfied, but the second
requirement is not, since T0[1] > VC0[2]. The missing link is as follows: Process 2 has not
received the first message m1 from process 0, but process 1 has already received it prior
to sending the current message. Process 2 therefore saves this message in a holdback
queue, accepts the next incoming message from process 0 and delivers it (which updates its
VC to 1, 0, 0), and then delivers the pending message m2. The algorithm for causal order
multicast can thus be summarized as follows:
Send: Sender j increments VCj[j] and appends T = VC[j] to message m.
Receive: To deliver m, receiver i waits until the conditions (1) Tj[j] = VCj[i] + 1 and (2)
∀k ≠ j:Tk[j] ≤ VCk[i] hold. Thereafter, the receiver delivers m and updates VC[i] as follows:
∀k:0 ≤ k ≤ n−1::VCk[i]=max(Tk[j], VCk[i]).
15.6 RELIABLE MULTICAST
Compared to basic multicasts, the additional requirement of reliable multicasts is that
only correct processes will receive the messages from all correct processes in the group.
Multicasts by faulty processes* will be received either by every correct process or by
* These processes might have failed after the multicast is initiated.

none at all. Let n processes {0, 1, 2,…, n−1} form a closed group and assume that multicasts
are implemented as a sequence of unicasts. An implementation that survives the crash
failure of members is described later. Note that we consider the communication links to
be reliable.

do i ≠ n→ accept it;
send message m to i; multicast m to every member;
i:=i+1 [] m is not a new message → discard m
od fi
If the sender crashes before sending a single message, then no one receives it, and atomicity
trivially holds. Otherwise, if the sender crashes at the middle of the multicast,
then the receivers carry out the unfinished work of the sender by forwarding each
newly received message to every other member of the group. This satisfies the requirement
of atomic multicast, although at the expense of a large number of messages, the
complexity of which is O(n2). The message complexity can be reduced if the maximum
number t of faulty processes is known. For example, if t = 1, then after the initiator i
sends out one round of messages, it is adequate for one more process j to send a second
round of messages. Success is guaranteed since both i and j cannot crash—so every
nonfaulty process must receive a copy of the message. The maximum number of messages
is limited to 2n.
15.6.1 Scalable Reliable Multicast
Practical multicast systems deal not only with process crashes but also with omission
failures and network partitions. IP multicast or application layer multicast provides no
guarantee for reliability. Several issues must be addressed in such systems: (1) detection
of message loss and types of feedback (ack, nack, etc.) to be used, (2) sending the feedback
to the sender, (3) retransmission of lost or corrupted messages, and (4) congestion
control and scalability. To add to the complications, the composition of the group may
change at any time. An implementation of reliable multicast for large-scale systems is
addressed here.
Let m[0] through m[k−1] be a sequence of k messages that a sender wants to multicast
to its group of size n. We first consider a minimal program for reliable multicast
that works on bounded delay channels and rules out the failure of the sender or change
of group membership. After each basic multicast, the sender expects (n − 1) acks from
the group members within a time-out period. If this does not arrive, then the initiator
retransmits the message using another instance of basic multicast. When the sender
receives (n − 1) acks, it begins the multicast of the next message. A closer look will reveal
that this is essentially an implementation of reliable local order multicast in the presence
of omission failures.
328 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Program Reliable Multicast
{Sender’s program}
define: seq, count : integer
initially seq = 0; count = 0; {counts the number of ack’s};
do (seq ≠ k − 1)∧(count = 0)→ (basic) multicast (m[seq],seq)
[] ack received → count:=count+1
[] (seq ≠ k − 1)∧(count ≠ n − 1)∧timeout→ (basic) multicast (m[seq],seq)
[] (seq ≠ k − 1)∧(count = n − 1)→ seq: = seq + 1;count:= 0;
od
{Receiver’s program}
define r: integer; {initially r = 0}
do seq = r → deliver m[seq];send ack; r:=r + 1
[]seq ≠ r → send ack for the last received message
od
When n is large, the number of acks is a clear bottleneck in the scalability of the previous
scheme. If omission failures are rare, then a more scalable scheme is as follows: Receivers
will only report the nonreceipt of messages using nack, instead of using positive acks for
reporting the receipt of messages. This triggers selective point-to-point retransmission—
and either the sender or another member that received the message will forward the missing
message. Members will eventually delete the received messages from their local buffers
after a time-out period. The reduction of acks is the underlying principle of scalable reliable
multicasts (SRMs).
Floyd et al.’s [FJM+97] idea takes the principle one step further by allowing negative
feedback to be combined or suppressed. If several members of a group fail to receive a
message, then each such member will apparently multicast its nack to all the other members.
However, the algorithm requires each such member to wait for a random period
of time before sending its nack. If in the mean time one such member notices a nack
sent by another member, then it suppresses the sending of its own nack. It is sufficient
(and in fact, ideal) for the sender to receive only one nack for a given missing message,
following which it multicasts the missing message to all recipients. In practice, Floyd’s
scheme reduces the number of nacks sent back to the sender for each missing message,
although it is rarely reduced to a single nack. However, reductions in the scale of redundant
retransmissions save bandwidth. Finally, upon receiving a nack for a missing message,
another member may supply that message from its local cache, thus saving the
overhead of a system-wide retransmission. The proper orchestration of these techniques
helps in drastically reducing the number of retransmitted messages, which saves bandwidth
and improves scalability.
15.6.2 Reliable Ordered Multicast
Some reliable versions of ordered multicasts can be implemented by replacing each basic
multicast component of the implementation by its reliable version. Interestingly, total order
Group Communication ◾ 329
reliable multicasts cannot be implemented on an asynchronous system in the presence of
crash failures. The following theorem explains why it is so.
Theorem 15.1
In an asynchronous distributed system, total order multicasts cannot be implemented
when even a single process crashes.
Proof: If we could implement total order multicasts in the presence of crash failures,
then we could as well solve the asynchronous consensus problem in the following
manner: Let each correct process enter the messages received by it in a local queue.
If every correct process picks the head of the queue as its final decision, then consensus
is reached. But we already know from Theorem 13.1 that the consensus problem
cannot be solved in an asynchronous system even if a single process crashes. So it is
impossible to implement total order multicasts in an asynchronous system in the presence
of a crash failure. ◾
15.7 OPEN GROUPS
Open groups allow members to spontaneously join and leave. Changing group sizes adds a
new twist to the problems of group communication and needs a precise specification of the
requirements. Consider a group g that initially consists of four members {0, 1, 2, 3}. Assume
that each member knows the current membership of this group. We call this a view of the
group and represent it as V(g)={0, 1, 2}.
When members do not have identical views, problems can arise. Such situations can occur
due to the local nature of the join or leave operations and the latency of information propagation.
As a simple example, suppose the members of the group {0, 1, 2, 3} have been given
the responsibility of sending out emails to 144 persons. Initially, every member had the view
{0, 1, 2, 3}, so they decided that each would send out 144/4 = 36 emails to equally share the load.
Due to some reason, member 3 left the group and only 2 knew about this, while others were
not updated about 3’s departure. Therefore, the views of the remaining three members will be
as follows:
V(g ) = {0,1, 2, 3} for member 0
V(g ) = {0,1, 2, 3} for member 1
V(g ) = {0,1, 2} for member 2
As a result, members 0 and 1 will send out emails 0–35 and 36–71 (the first and the second
quarter of the task), member 2 will send out 97–144 (the last one-third of the task), and the
emails 72–96 will never be sent out!
330 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Membership service
A basic group membership service deals with the following tasks:
1. Handles the join and leave operations of members
2. Propagates the latest view of the group to the members
3. Detects failures
The second component requires inputs from the first and the third components. Thus, in
addition to the voluntary join and leave operations, group compositions can change due to
the involuntary or unannounced departure (i.e., crash) of members or network partitions.
The view of a group is extremely relevant before a member executes an action. The membership
service propagates view changes in identical order to all the members. As an example,
let V0(g)={0, 1, 2, 3} be the initial view. Assume that members 1 and 2 leave the group, and
member 4 joins the group concurrently. The membership service, upon detection of these
events, serializes the interim views and installs them at the various members—this enables
all processes observe the view changes in the same order. There are several feasible serializations
(which may depend on how and when joins and leaves were detected) in this case, such
as the following:
{0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 3}, {0, 3, 4}
{0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 3}, {0, 3}, {0, 3, 4}
{0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 3}, {0, 3, 4}
Views are propagated just like messages, so processes send and receive messages in specific
views. This simplifies the specification of the semantics of multicast in open groups and
the development of application programs. Examples of message sequences for two different
members are as follows:
{Process 0}: V0(g);
send m1, … ;
V1(g);
send m2, send m3, receive m6;
V2(g);
{Process 1}: V0(g);
send m4, send m5, receive m1;
V1(g);
receive m2, send m6;
V2(g);
where, V0(g)={0, 1, 2, 3}, V1(g)={0, 1, 3}, V2(g)={0, 3, 4}
Communication actions that take place between the views Vi(g) and Vi+1(g) are said to have
taken place in view Vi(g). The switching of views does not happen instantaneously across
Group Communication ◾ 331
the entire network; rather, views are eventually delivered to all nonfaulty members. The
following two properties hold for view delivery in open groups:
Property 1: Let i ∈ V(g). If a member j joins group g and thereafter continues its membership
in g, then eventually j appears in all views delivered by process i.
Property 2: Let i, j ∈ V(g). If member j permanently leaves group g, then eventually j is
excluded from all views delivered by process i.
15.7.1 View-Synchronous Group Communication
View-synchronous group communication (also known as virtual synchrony) presents to
each processor a consistent total order of views and defines how messages will be delivered
to the members with respect to these views. Since crashes change group composition and
process views, the specifications of view-synchronous group communication takes crashes
into account. Let a message m be multicast by a group member, and before it is delivered to
the current members, a new member joins the group. Will the message m be delivered to the
new member? Or consider the distribution of a secret key to the members of a group. While
the distribution was in progress, a member left the group. Should that member receive the
key? There perhaps can be many policies. View synchrony specifies one such policy. The guiding
principle of view-synchronous group communication is that with respect to each message,
all correct processes must have the same view, that is, if a message is sent in a view V(g), then
it should be received in the same view (Figure 15.6). Thus, there should be basic agreement
about the next view as well as the set of messages delivered in the current view. This translates
to a sequentially consistent (see Chapter 16) interface for the members of the group.
In the presence of crash failures, there are three key requirements of view-synchronous
group communication:
Agreement: If a member k delivers a message m in view Vi(g) before delivering the next
view Vi+1(g), then every nonfaulty member j ∈ Vi(g) ∩ Vi+1(g) must deliver m before
delivering Vi+1(g).
Integrity: If a member j delivers a view Vi(g), then Vi(g) must include j.
Validity: If a member k delivers a message m in view Vi(g) and another member j ∈ Vi(g)
does not deliver that message m, then the next view Vi+1(g) delivered by k must exclude j.

332 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Consider the example in Figure 15.7. Here, process 1 sends out a message m and then
crashes, so the group view eventually changes from {0, 1, 2, 3} to {0, 2, 3}. How will the
surviving processes handle this message? Here are three possibilities:
Possibility 1: No one delivers m, but each delivers the new view {0, 2, 3}.
Possibility 2: Processes 0, 2, 3 deliver m and then deliver the new view {0, 2, 3}.
Possibility 3: Processes 2, 3 deliver m and then deliver the new view {0, 2, 3}, but process 0
first delivers the view {0, 2, 3} and then delivers m.
Of these three possibilities, 1 and 2 are acceptable, but 3 is not—since it violates the agreement
criteria of view-synchronous communication.
15.8 OVERVIEW OF TRANSIS
Danny Dolev of Hebrew University of Jerusalem directed the project Transis. Its goal
was to support various forms of group communication. The multicast communication
layer of Transis facilitates the development of fault-tolerant applications in a network
of machines. Transis is derived from the earlier work in the ISIS project undertaken at
Cornell University. Transis supports most of the features supported by ISIS. Among several
enhancements over ISIS, Transis takes advantage of the multicast facility available in
the routers, thus maintaining a high communication bandwidth. A message addressed to
a group is sent only once. Atomicity of multicasts is guaranteed and the desired message
delivery order is maintained, whereas message losses and transient network failures are
transparent. Reliable communication is based on the Trans protocol devised originally by
Melliar-Smith et al. Trans piggybacks acks (both positive and negative) with multicast
messages. All messages and acks contain a progressively increasing sequence number that
starts from 0. Message losses may be caused due to hardware faults, or buffer overflows,
or (sometimes) due to the inability to retrieve messages at a high speed from the network.
Each ack is sent only once, and the acks from other processes form a causal chain,
from which the loss of messages can be deduced. Consider a group consisting of processes

P,Q,R,S,… . Let process P multicast a sequence of messages P0,P1,P2,… to the group members,
and let pk denote the ack of the message Pk. If piQj denotes the ack pi piggybacked on
the message Qj, then the sequence of messages P0,P1,P2,Q0,p2Q1,Q2,q3R0… received by a
member of the group will reveal to that member that it did not receive message Q3 so far.
It will send a nack for Q3 requesting its retransmission. In response to this, another group
member that has Q3 in its buffer can retransmit Q3.
Transis handles network partitioning caused by communication failures, but guarantees
that virtual synchrony is maintained within each partition. After the connectivity
is restored, virtual synchrony is eventually restored in the entire system. Group
communication systems developed prior to Transis (often called first-generation systems)
made no guarantees when a partition occurred—in most cases, only the primary
component was operational. Transis provides four major modes of multicast communication.
These are the following:
Single-source FIFO: If a process multicasts two messages in the order (m1, m2), then
every correct process in the group must deliver m1 before m2.
Causal mode: Messages that are causally related are delivered to the members according
to the causal order.
Agreed mode: Messages are delivered in the same total order at all processes. It is a
special version of total order communication mode with the added requirement that
message delivery order has to be consistent with the causal order.
Safe mode: Messages are delivered according to the agreed mode, with the additional
constraint that all other group members’ machines must confirm the receipt of the
message. This is possible only after the lower levels of the system have received acks
from all the destination machines. Safe mode guarantees that (1) if a safe message m
reaches a process P in a given configuration, then P will deliver that message unless
it crashes and (2) every other message is ordered relative to a safe message. When a
network partition occurs, some members deliver a message and some do not. The
first guarantee allows a process to know for certain who has delivered a safe message
(or crashed). The second guarantee means that if a safe message m was multicast and
delivered in a certain configuration, then any message will be delivered by all processes
either before m or after m. Of the three modes of communication, the causal
mode of communication is the fastest, and the safe mode is the slowest, since it has to
explicitly wait for all acks.
The concept of virtual synchrony, when extended to a partitioned environment is known as
extended virtual synchrony. When a process moves to a different partition, it is treated as a
failed process by its fellow processes in the previous configuration. One requirement is failure
atomicity—if two processes proceed together from one configuration to the next, then
they deliver an identical set of messages. An example of a safe message delivery in a partitioned
environment is illustrated in Figure 15.8. Assume that A was sending a safe message
334 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
m to the group of three members {A, B, C}, and the configuration partitioned from {A, B, C}
→ {A, B}, {C}. In case (a), all but C sent ack to A. In order to deliver m, the members A and
B must receive the new view {A, B} first—this is a confirmation that only A and B are currently
in the partition and the members should not wait for the ack from C [VES99]. In case
(b), C sent the ack and also received a copy of the ack sent out by A and B just before the
partition occurred. Now, C can deliver m before receiving the new view {C}. Otherwise, if
it receives the new view {C}, then C can ignore m as a spurious message.
Process groups are dynamic. A member may voluntarily leave a group or lose its
membership following a crash. In case of a partition, each component continues to operate
separately, but each process identifies the processes in the other partition to have
failed. The application is notified about this change in the group membership. To keep
track of membership changes, ISIS used an approximate failure detector that relied on
time-out: A process that fails to respond within the time-out period is presumed to be
faulty and messages directed toward it are discarded. In contrast, Transis presumes that
a failed machine can potentially rejoin the group later and need not give up.
15.9 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Since group-oriented activities have significantly increased in commerce and academia, the
scalability and reliability of group communication services are major issues. Causal order
multicasts using vector time stamps suffer from poor scalability. The situation is equally
bad for total order multicasts too, unless a separate sequencer process is used. However, in
that case, the sequencer itself may be a bottleneck. Practical systems like Transis achieved
scalability using hardware facilities in the router, piggybacking acks, and using a combination
of positive and negative acknowledgments to recover missing messages.

EXERCISES
15.1 In a group, there are eight members, of which at most one can crash at any time.
You have no idea about which process can crash. If the topology is a completely
connected network, then in the worst case, what is the smallest number of messages
needed to guarantee reliable atomic multicast from a given process to the entire
group? What is the rationale behind your decision? How will you modify your
answer of up to four members can crash at any time?
(Hint: The worst case corresponds to the situation when no process fails, but no one
knows about it.)
15.2 Two processes 0 and 1 form a group and want to create a shared bulletin board, so they
decide to implement causal order atomic multicast using vector clocks. At a certain
point, process 1’s local vector clock is (0, 2) and it received a message m (from process
0) stamped with vector clock value of (2, 1). Which one of the following steps will
process 1 take?
a. Accept m now.
b. Accept m only after receiving a message with VC = (1, 1).
c. Accept m only after receiving two messages with VC = (1, 0) (1, 1).
d. Accept m only after receiving three messages with VC = (1, 0) (1, 1) (2, 0).
e. None of the above is true.
15.3 Three processes 0, 1, 2 of a group communicate with one another, and the requirement
is causal order multicast. A message from process 0 has a vector time stamp
(1, 2, 0), and it reaches node 2 when its local vector clock is (0, 1, 2).
a. Draw a diagram reconstructing the exchange of all the messages in the group.
b. Will the message be accepted by process 2? Explain.
15.4 Consider an election in a state. The citizens cast their votes at the individual polling centers.
At the end of the day when the poll closes, counting begins. Each count recorded at
336 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
a center is multicast to all the other centers, so that all of them exactly know the latest
count at any time when the counting is in progress. The interconnection topology of
the network connecting the polling centers is a completely connected graph.
a. Assume that at any time failures can bring down some of the communication
lines without creating a partition. What kind of multicast will guarantee that all
centers are able to record every vote?
b. Assume that communication failure partitioned the network for an hour.
Apparently, the counting must stop. What would you recommend so that the
progress of counting is not affected even if the network temporarily partitions?
15.5 Consider a multiparty game of quiz involving five teams. Each team poses a question
and a member of another team has to answer it. The team that answers the
question first scores a point. If no team can answer a question within 30 s, then no
one scores any point. The clocks are synchronized, so who answered first is decided
by the time when the reply was posted. The teams can pose questions at any time
and in no particular order. What kind of multicast is appropriate here?
15.6 Different applications of group communication demand different types of ordered
multicast. Consider the problem of maintaining a shared calendar of appointments
by four different clerks, each having a separate copy of the calendar. A clerk will
make an entry into his or her own copy of the shared calendar and send it to the
other three clerks. The requirement is that after any finite sequence of updates, all
four copies of the calendars must be identical and meaningful (thus, if you first
make an appointment at 10 a.m. on January 3, 2013, with one clerk and then change
it to 9 a.m. on January 4, 2013, with another clerk, then the last entry will prevail).
In case of conflicts (like two persons trying to make appointments for the same
time slot, the second one will be rejected). What kind of ordered multicast will you
recommend? Explain your answer.
15.7 The members of a group use view-synchronous communication to communicate
with one another. Initially, there are four processes 0, 1, 2, 3. Process 0 sent a message
m in view (0, 1, 2, 3). Processes 0, 1, and 2 delivered the message m, but process 3
did not. Is this an acceptable behavior? Justify your answer.
15.8 Bob is the president of the Milky Way club of sky watchers and also the president of
the Himalayan Hikers club of nature lovers. From time to time, Bob will send out
messages to the members of these groups, and these messages will be delivered in
the FIFO order among the group members.
Now assume that some members of the Milky Way club also join the Himalayan
Hikers club; as a result, the two groups overlapped. Argue why the FIFO-ordered
multicast algorithm may not work for the members who belong to both clubs. Also,
suggest modifications that will preserve the FIFO order of message delivery among
members of both clubs, including those in the intersection.
15.9 Consider two groups A and B each containing a set of members. Assume that within
each group, total order multicast and causal order multicast have already been
Group Communication ◾ 337
implemented. Assume that some members of group A became members of group
B too. Using the existing implementations
a. Will causal order multicast correctly work if the groups overlap?
b. Will total order multicast correctly work if the groups overlap?
Briefly justify your answer.
15.10 (Programming exercise) Implementing totally ordered multicast
Implement a distributed chat program using a programming language of your
choice. When a user types in a message, it should show up at all users. Further, all
users should see all messages in the same order. Your program should use totally
ordered multicast algorithm based on a sequencer process. To multicast a message,
a user p sends the message to the sequencer. The sequencer assigns a number to the
message, returns this number to p, and sends the message to all machines in the
group together with the sequence number.
Use process 0 as the sequencer. You may or may not allow the sequencer to be a
user in the chat. You will need to implement a holdback queue at each user.
15.11 (Programming exercise) Implementing casually ordered multicast
Implement causal order broadcast in a group of 16 processes. You will write a
program for a client class. This class will store the name of all the clients including its
own. This client should also provide the interface including following two functions:
public boolean SendMessage(String strMessage)
This method should send the message to all clients.
public String ReceiveMessage()
This method should return the next message to the client from a pool of messages
satisfying the causal order requirement. Remember that the underlying platform is
non-FIFO.
public void AddClient(String strClientName) -
This method should add another client to this client’s list.
For interclient communication, use the SimulateSocket.class that simulates non-
FIFO channels on a reliable network and will garble the message order arbitrarily.
The SimulateSocket.class has the following interface:
public SimulateSocket(String strClientName)
This function opens up a new communication channel for the calling client.
public int send(Object objSend, String ReceiverClientName)
This function sends required object to the recipient client.
public Object receive()
This function fetches the next message available for calling client. Remember, this
message need not be in FIFO order.
Specify a distributed chat simulation scenario (e.g., label a message from A to B as
(A, B) and its response as Re[1]: (A, B), the response to Re[1]: (A, B) as Re[2]: (A, B)).
338 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
All messages are sent to the entire group—there are no one-to-one messages.
Thus, Re[3]: (A, B) is causally ordered before Re[5]: (A, B), but Re[12]: (A, B) is not
causally ordered before Re[2]: (B, C). Your experiment should let the clients run
chats with titles as earlier. At the end of say 32 messages sent by each process, stop
the chat and examine the order of message delivery at each process, and observe
that the causal order is not violated. Provide a copy of the client class that you have
written along with the test program that validates your client class. Also, prepare a
small document that will describe why and how your program works.

Replicated Data Management
16.1 INTRODUCTION
Data replication is an age-old technique for tolerating faults, increasing data availability,
and reducing latency in data access. With online activities taking over our lives, our critical
data, both personal and professional, are being increasingly stored in data centers somewhere
in the globe. Such data are replicated across multiple data centers either proactively
or reactively, so that even when some of the copies are lost due to a crash or become inaccessible
due to a network partition, our data still remain intact and accessible. Cached copies of
downloaded data on our personal devices enable us to use them even if the network connectivity
is absent. Apart from data backup, replication is widely used in the implementation of
distributed shared memory (DSM), distributed file systems, and bulletin boards.
In addition to fault tolerance, replication reduces access latency. DNS servers at the
upper levels are highly replicated—without this, IP address lookup will be unacceptably
slow. Accordingly, in large systems (like P2P systems and grids), how many replicas will
be required to bring down the latency of access to an acceptable level and where to place
them are interesting questions. Another major problem in replication management is that
of replica update. The problem does not exist if the data are read-only, which is true for
program codes or immutable data. When a replica is updated, every other copy of that data
has to be eventually updated to maintain coherence. However, due to the finite computation
speed of processors and the network latencies involved in updating geographically
dispersed copies, it is possible that even after one copy has been updated, users of the other
copies still access the old version. What inconsistencies are permissible and how coherence
can be restored are important issues in replicated data management.
16.1.1 Reliability versus Availability
Two primary motivations behind data replication are reliability and availability. Data replicated
in the cloud not only serve as a backup and safeguard against failures but also
facilitate anytime anywhere availability through a simple browser. In the WWW, proxy
servers provide service when the main server becomes overloaded. All these illustrate how
replication can improve data or service availability. There may be cases in which the service
340 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
provided by a proxy server is not as efficient as the service provided by the main server—
but certainly, it is better than having no service at all. This is an example of graceful degradation.
When all servers are up and running and client accesses are uniform, the quality
of service goes up since the server loads are balanced. In mobile terminals and handheld
devices, disconnected modes of operation are important, and replication of data or service
offers partition tolerance and minimizes the disruption of service. Redundant array of
inexpensive disks (RAID) is another example of providing reliability and improving availability
through replication.
Reliability and availability address two orthogonal issues. A server that is reliable but
rarely available serves no purpose. Similarly, a server that is available but frequently malfunctions
or supplies incorrect or stale data causes headache for all.
Consider two users, Alice and Bob, updating a shared file F. There may be a single copy
of F, or Alice and Bob each may want to maintain a private replica of F (Figure 16.1). Each
user’s life is as follows:
{Alice and Bob sharing a file F}
do true →
read F;
modify F;
write F
od
Depending on how the file is maintained, the write operation (1) will update a central copy
of F that is shared by both (2) or will update the local copies of F separately maintained
by Alice and Bob. In either case, ideally, Alice’s updates must reach Bob before he initiates
the read operation, and vice versa. However, with separate local replicas, this may not be
possible due to channel latencies, so Bob may either read a stale copy or postpone reading
until the update arrives. What is an acceptable semantics of sharing F? This will depend on
data consistency models.
16.2 ARCHITECTURE OF REPLICATED DATA MANAGEMENT
Ideally, replicated data management must be transparent. Transparency implies that
users have the illusion of using a single copy of the data or the object—even if multiple
copies of a shared data exist or replicated servers provide a specific service, the clients
should not have any knowledge of which replica is supplying the data or which server is

providing the service. It is conceptually reassuring for the clients to believe in the existence
of a single server that is highly available and trustworthy, although in real life, different
replicas may take turns to create the illusion of a single reliable copy of data or server.
Although ideal replication transparency can be rarely achieved, approximating replication
transparency is one of the architectural goals of replicated data management.
16.2.1 Passive versus Active Replication
For maintaining replication transparency, two different architectural models are widely
used: passive replication and active replication. In passive replication, every client communicates
with a single replica called the primary. In addition to the primary, one or more replicas
are used as backup copies. Figure 16.2 illustrates this. If the primary is up and running, it
provides the desired service. If the request from a client does not modify the state of the
server, no further action is necessary. If, however, client actions modify the server state, to
keep the states of the backup servers consistent, the primary performs an atomic multicast
of the updates to the backup servers, before sending the response to the client. If the primary
crashes, one of the backup servers is elected as the new primary.
The primary-backup replication architecture satisfies the following specifications:
1. At most, one replica can be the primary server at any time.
2. Each client maintains a variable L (leader) that specifies the replica to which it will
send requests. Requests are queued at the primary server.
3. Backup servers ignore client requests.
There may be periods of time when there is no primary server—this happens during a
changeover after the primary server has crashed, and a backup server is yet to be designated
as the new primary. This period is called the failover time. When repairs are ignored,
the primary-backup approach implements a service that can tolerate a bounded number of
faults over the lifetime of the service. Here, unless specified otherwise, a failure implies a
server crash. Since the primary server returns a response to the client after completing an
atomic multicast, when a client receives a response, it is assured that each nonfaulty replica

has received the update. The primary server periodically broadcasts heartbeat messages to
the backups. If a backup server fails to receive this message within a specific window of
time, it concludes that the primary has crashed and initiates an election. The new leader
takes over as the new primary and notifies the clients. Figure 16.3 illustrates the basic steps
of the primary-backup protocol.
To maintain replication transparency, the earlier switchover must be instantaneous. But
in real life, this may not be true. Consider the following description of the life of a client:
do request for service → receive response from the server
[] timeout → retransmit the request to the server
od
If due to the crash of the primary the client does not receive a response within a time-out
period, the request for service is retransmitted. In fact, multiple retransmissions may be
necessary, until a backup server becomes the new primary server. This happens during the
failover time. An important question is: If at most m servers can crash, then what are the
smallest possible values of the degree of replication and the failover time?
At least (m + 1) replicas are sufficient to tolerate the crash of m servers, since to provide
service, it is sufficient to have only one server up and running. From Figure 16.3, the
smallest failover time is (τ + 2δ + T) where τ is the interval between the two consecutive
heartbeat messages, T is the election time, and δ is the maximum message propagation
delay between a client and a backup server. This corresponds to the case when the primary
crashes immediately after sending a heartbeat message and an update message to the
backup servers.
An alternative to passive replication is active replication. Here, each of the n clients
communicates
with a group of k(1 < k ≤ n) servers (also called replica managers). Unlike the
primary-
backup model, these servers do not have any master–slave relationship among
them. Figure 16.4 shows a bulletin board shared by a group of members. Each member i uses
her local copy Bi of the bulletin board. Whenever a member posts an update, her local copy
is updated, and the update is propagated to each of the servers using total order multicast
(so that eventually all copies of the bulletin board become identical). By combining the output
of the servers in this ensemble, one can obtain the output of the fault-tolerant state machine.

16.2.2 Fault-Tolerant State Machines
Client–server-based architecture is widely used in the implementation of distributed systems.
A server can be viewed as a deterministic state machine that executes client actions
in some sequence. The state machine has a current state; it executes a step by executing an
input command from the client, which produces an output and a new state. As an example,
consider a distributed banking system with the tellers as clients. The state of the state
machine consists of the account balances of all users. A deposit will change the state of
the state machine producing as output the old and the new balances. When implemented
as a single server, the failure of that server can completely halt the banking system. To
implement a fault-tolerant state machine, we therefore use a collection of servers, each one
independently implementing the state machine. When started from the same initial state,
in spite of the failure of a fraction of the servers, all nonfaulty servers will produce the
same sequences of states and outputs. A client issuing a command can then use the output
generated by any nonfaulty server. The replica coordination problem can be reduced to the
consensus problem, since all state machines have to agree to the choice of the next request
that will be used to update its state.
The degree of replication k will depend on the nature and the extent of the failure. In
[Sch90], Schneider presented a theory of fault-tolerant state machines, and it captures the
essence of maintaining a fault-tolerant service via active replication. Central to this theory
are reliable atomic multicasts (Chapter 15). The following two requirements must be satisfied
by any implementation of a fault-tolerant state machine:
Agreement: Every correct replica receives all the requests.
Order: Every correct replica receives the requests in the same order.

FIGURE 16.4 An example of active replication with n = 4 clients and k = 4 servers. Each client’s
message is multicast to every other server.
344 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The agreement part is solved using the reliable atomic multicast protocol of Section 15.2.
The implementation of the order part demands that this be further strengthened to total
order reliable multicast. However, no deterministic solution is feasible on asynchronous
distributed systems (since it will disprove the FLP impossibility result; see Theorem 15.1),
so a synchronous model must be used.
With at most m faulty replicas, at least (m + 1) replicas are adequate since the faulty processes
produce correct outputs until they fail. To read a value, a client’s machine queries the
servers one after another, and the first response that it receives is the desired value.
If instead the failures were byzantine, then to compensate for the erroneous behavior of
faulty processes, at least (2m + 1) replicas would be required, so that the faulty processes
become a minority, and the bad values can be voted out using a simple majority. However,
this assumes that all correct replicas have identical values after every multicast, and with
only (2m + 1) replicas, this guarantee cannot be provided. To guarantee that all correct replicas
are updated to identical values after each multicast in the presence of m byzantine failures,
one of the protocols from Section 13.3 should be used. If the oral message algorithm is
used, then at least (3m + 1) replicas will be required. The order part can be satisfied by modifying
the total order multicast protocols of Section 15.5.1 so that it deals with faulty replicas.
In most implementations, time stamps determine the desired order in which updates
will be delivered to the replicas. An update is stable, if no update with a lower time stamp
is expected to arrive after it. Only stable updates will be delivered to the state machines.
Consider a replica i receiving time-stamped updates from the other replicas 1, 2, 3,… via
channels (1, i), (2, i), (3, i),…. If nonfaulty replicas communicate infinitely often and the
channels are FIFO, then each state machine replica will receive through every channel the
updates in the ascending order of time stamps. The dilemma here is that some nonfaulty
replicas may not have any update to send for a long time. This affects the stability test.
While applying an update with time stamp t, how will a replica decide if an update with
a time stamp smaller than t will not arrive in the future via some other channel? One
approach to overcome this and make progress is to ask nonfaulty servers to periodically
send out null requests when it has no update to send. It is possible to combine the null messages
with the periodic heartbeat messages that are exchanged among the replica servers.
An alternative is to use real time as a basis of ordering the pending updates—from the
known upper bound of the message propagation delay, a receiving process can deduce that
the sender did not have anything to send up to a certain time. Since crash of a replica is
detectable, a replica will ignore the channel from a faulty replica. This will handle stability
in the presence of crash failures.
If the failure is byzantine, then a faulty client (or a faulty replica connected to a client)
may refuse to send the null message. However, since the upper bound of the message propagation
delay is known, the absence of a message can be detected.
16.3 DATA-CENTRIC CONSISTENCY MODELS
Replica consistency requires all copies of data to be eventually identical. However, due to
the inherent latency in message propagation, it is sometimes possible for the clients to
receive anomalous responses. Here is an example: In a particular flight, all the seats were
Replicated Data Management ◾ 345
sold out, and two persons A and B in two different cities have been trying to make reservations.
At 9:37:00, there was a cancellation by passenger C. A tried to reserve a seat at 9:37:25
but failed to reserve the seat. Surprisingly, B tried to make the reservation at 9:38:00 and
could grab it! While this appears awkward at a first glance, its acceptability hinges on the
type of consistency model that is being used. Consistency determines what responses are
acceptable following an update of a replica. It is a contract between the clients and the replica
management system.
A DSM creates the illusion of a shared memory on top of a message-passing system
(Figure 16.5). It can potentially support many data consistency models. Such consistency
models are relevant in various applications like distributed file systems, distributed databases,
and web caching. The choice of a consistency model also influences the efficiency
of concurrent programming. From the user’s perspective, stronger models impose severe
restrictions on the system behavior, whereas weaker models tend to relax them. In the following,
we present a few well-known consistency models:
1. Strict consistency
2. Linearizability
3. Sequential consistency
4. Causal consistency
5. FIFO consistency
16.3.1 Strict Consistency
The trace (also called history) of a computation is a sequence of read (R) and write (W)
operations on a shared variable x. One or more processes can execute these operations. We
assume that each read and write operation is atomic.
Strict consistency corresponds to true replication transparency. If one of the processes
executes x ≔ 5 at real time t and this is the latest write operation, then at a real time t′ > t,
every process trying to read x will receive the value 5. Strict consistency criterion requires

S
FIGURE 16.5 A DSM with four processes P, Q, R, S sharing a read–write object X.
346 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
that regardless of the number of replicas of x, every process receives a response that is consistent
with the real time. Uniprocessor systems with a single copy of each variable trivially
satisfy strict consistency.
The scenario in the previous example of two passengers A and B trying to reserve airline
seats does not satisfy the strict consistency criteria, since even if a seat was released at
9:37:00 via a cancellation, the availability of the seat was not visible to A at 9:37:25. Due to
the nonzero latency of the messages, strict consistency is not implementable on distributed
hardware. Note that read and write operations are considered to be nonblocking (otherwise,
one could allow the writer to acquire exclusive right to update all the copies before the
update begins, and readers would remain blocked until the update ends).
16.3.2 Linearizability
Strict consistency is too strong and requires all replicas to be updated instantaneously.
A slightly weaker version of consistency is linearizability.
Define a composite trace as an interleaving of the individual reads and writes into a single
total order that respects the internal ordering of the actions of every process, as well as the
external ordering of actions between processes as defined by their time stamp values. If such
a composite trace is consistent, which means that every read returns the latest value written
into the shared variable preceding that read operation, then the shared object is linearizable.
Figure 16.6 shows two example traces with two shared variables x and y. Initially, x = y = 0.
For (b), the read and write operations by the processes A and B lead to the composite trace {init}
WA(x := 1)RA(y = 1)WB(y := 1)RB(x = 1), which is not consistent, so linearizability is not satisfied.
16.3.3 Sequential Consistency
A slightly weaker (and more widely used) form of consistency is sequential consistency. To
understand the notion of sequential consistency, form a composite trace as an interleaving
of the individual reads and writes that respect the internal ordering of the actions of
every process, but it is not necessary to respect the external ordering of actions between
processes. Clearly, many such composite traces can be generated. Of all such traces, if there
is at least one consistent trace, then sequential consistency is satisfied. The key concept in
sequential consistency is that all processes should see all the write operations in the same
order as in a consistent composite trace. Thus, if a write x:= u precedes another write x := v
in a trace, then no process reading x will read x = v before x = u.

Linearizability is stronger than sequential consistency, that is, every linearizable
object is also sequentially consistent. Therefore, the trace in Figure 16.6a satisfies
sequential consistency. However, consider the trace in Figure 16.6b—it is not linearizable,
but one can still generate a consistent composite trace WA(x: = 1)WB(y: = 1)RA(y = 1)
RB(x = 1) out of it (WB(y: = 1) can be placed before RA(y = 1) since there is no obligation to
respect the time stamp values when ordering action between two different processes).
So sequential consistency holds.
Consider again the example of two customers B and C interacting with the airlines
reservation system (Figure 16.7a), and assume that the total number of available seats in
the flight is 100. This behavior is sequentially consistent, since there exists a consistent
composite trace:
{init}RB(seat )WA(seat : )RC (seat ) =100 = 99 = 99
If client B is unhappy with this anomalous outcome of the reservation system, then she is
perhaps asking for linearizability.
The scenario in Figure 16.7b does not satisfy sequential consistency. The actions of
the processes A and B lead to the only feasible composite subtrace WA(x: = 10)RB(x = 10)
WB(x: = 20). However, process C reads x as 20 first and then reads x as 10, so the two consecutive
reads violate the program order of the two writes, and it is not possible to build a
consistent composite trace that satisfies the local or internal orders.
16.3.4 Causal Consistency
In the causal consistency model, every process must see all writes that are causally related,
in the same order. The order of values returned by various read operations must be consistent
with this causal order, forming a consistent composite trace. The writes may be
executed by the same process or by different processes. Writes that are not causally related
to one another can however be seen in any order by the different processes. Consequently,
these do not impose any constraint on the order of values read by a process. Figure 16.8
illustrates a causally consistent trace, but it is not sequentially consistent.

348 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
In this trace, there is no causal order between WA(x: = 10) and WB(x: = 20). Therefore,
processes C and D are free to read these values in any order, building their own perception
of the history of the write operations. The trace does not satisfy sequential consistency,
because that will require processes C and D to see the two writes in the same order, and
that order should be reflected in the values that they read out.
Why are there so many different consistency models? True replication transparency is
the ultimate target, and stronger consistency models are semantically closer to this target.
However, the implementation of stronger consistency models has a higher time complexity
and is thus inefficient. Weaker consistency models have fewer restrictions, are cheaper to
implement, and lead to faster operations. This is particularly relevant in large-scale systems.
16.3.5 FIFO Consistency
FIFO consistency further weakens the specifications of causal consistency. It only requires
that every process see all the write actions by a single process in the order in which they
were issued. Processes are free to see the write actions by different processes in any order,
even if they are causally related. Figure 16.9 shows an example. Processes C and D see the

two writes by process A in the same order. However, although there is a causal relation
between WA(x: = 10) and WB(x: = 20), processes C and D see them in different orders.
Consistency issues have been investigated in many different contexts. In addition to
DSM on multicomputers, consistency models have also been extensively studied for problems
related to cache coherence, web caching, distributed file systems, distributed databases,
and various highly available services.
16.4 CLIENT-CENTRIC CONSISTENCY PROTOCOLS
Data-centric consistency models have one thing in common: When multiple clients
simultaneously update a shared data, a write–write conflict results and has to be appropriately
resolved. In another variation of the problem, there are no write–write conflicts
to resolve. A single authority or server will update the data in the storage system, and
client side consistency has to do with how and when an observer sees updates made to
a data object. Consider the example of a web page in the WWW. Only the owner of the
page will update it. Usually, the updates are infrequent, and the number of reads far
outnumbers the number of updates. Since browsers and web proxies keep a copy of the
fetched page in their local cache and return it to the viewer following the next request,
quite often, stale versions of the web page may be returned to the viewer. To maintain
freshness, the cached copies are periodically discarded and updated pages are pulled
from the server. As a result, updates propagate to the clients in a lazy manner. There
will always be a window of inconsistency. Protocols that deal with consistency issues in
such cases are known as client-centric protocols. In the following, we present the eventual
consistency model, which is a popular model for client-centric consistency in large
distributed systems.
16.4.1 Eventual Consistency
In eventual consistency, the storage system guarantees that if there is no new update on the
data, then eventually all clients receive the correct view of the latest data. Such a model is
acceptable in many large databases—the most popular the DNS (Domain Name System),
where updates on a particular domain name are performed by designated naming authorities
and propagated in a lazy manner. Such updates are very infrequent and the implementation
overhead is small.
Eventual consistency is acceptable as long as a client accesses the same replica of the
shared data. Mobile clients can potentially access different versions of the replica and eventually
consistency may be unsatisfactory. Consider a busy executive trying to update a
database. She performs a part of the update, saves it in the cloud, then leaves for a meeting
in a different city, and in the evening decides to finish the remaining updates. Since she
may not be working on the same replica that she was working on in the morning (which of
course depends on the data replication policy in the data centers), she may notice that some
of the updates that she made in the morning are invisible. This means that consistency
models for mobile clients need separate attention.
350 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
16.4.2 Consistency Models for Mobile Clients
When replicas are geographically distributed, a mobile user will most likely use a replica
closest to her. The following four consistency models are based on the sequence of operations
that can be carried out by a mobile user:
1. Read-after-read
2. Write-after-write
3. Read-after-write
4. Write-after-read
16.4.2.1 Read-After-Read Consistency
Read-after-read or monotonic read consistency implies that when a read of a data set from
one server S is followed by a read of its replica from another server S′, each read from S′
should return a value that is at least as recent as the value previously read from S. Relate
this to the story of the busy executive and assume that she was reading emails in Iowa City
and then flew to Boston and started reading her emails from the same mailbox. She should
see all the emails that she read in Iowa City in the new location too.
16.4.2.2 Write-After-Write Consistency
Write-after-write or monotonic write consistency requires that when a write on a replica
in server S is followed by a write on another replica in a different server S′, the earlier
updates must be available to the replica in S′ before the next write is performed. An
update on a large data set or a structured data can sometimes be partial. Consider the
following scenario: Alice is the president of a company. She starts updating the salary
database of 100 employees. She finishes giving raises from her office in Dallas and then
travels to San Francisco, and there, she starts adding a 10% year-end bonus on the new
salary for her employees. If only the first half of the updates (i.e., employees 1–50) is
visible in the new location, then the bonus will not be correctly added to the salaries of
employees 51–100.
As another example, consider that Bob is updating a tuple from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). After
updating only the first element, that is, modifying (x1, y1) to (x2, y1), he moves to another
location and updates the second element of the tuple. If the first update is not visible in the
second location at the time of the second update, then after the second update, the value of
the tuple will be incorrectly written as (x1, y2) instead of the correct value (x2, y2). When
the old update arrives later, it modifies the tuple to (x2, y1). Ideally, all updates must be
applied on the previously updated values. Write-after-write consistency guarantees this.
This means that all replicas should be updated in the same order. In the data-centric
consistency model, this is equivalent to sequential consistency that expects some total
order among all writes. If writes are propagated in the incorrect order, then a recent update
may be overwritten by an older update. The order of updates can be relaxed when they are
commutative: for example, when the write operations update disjoint variables.
Replicated Data Management ◾ 351
16.4.2.3 Read-After-Write Consistency
Each client must be able to see the updates in a server S following every write operation by
itself on another server S′. This is also called read your writes.
Consider a large distributed store containing a massive collection of music. Clients set
up password-protected accounts for purchasing and downloading musical items of their
choice. If a client changes her password in one location, calls her spouse in a distant city,
and asks him to access the collection by logging into the account using her new password,
then he must be able to do so. Read-after-write consistency will guarantee that the new
password propagates to the new location before log in.
16.4.2.4 Write-After-Read Consistency
Each write operation following a read should take effect on the previously read copy, or a
more recent version of it. Consider that Alice checked her account balance in the Sunrise
Bank Iowa, and found that her paycheck of $1500 has been credited to her account, raising
her balance to $1900. She took a flight to Denver during the afternoon, went to a store
there, and tried to buy an item for $700 using her bankcard from the Sunrise Bank. But
to her embarrassment, the payment did not go through due to insufficient balance in the
account. Alice clearly remembered that she did not spend any money from her account
in the interim period. Her attempted write (deduction from her balance in the bank) did
not take place on the latest balance that she read before her departure from Iowa. This is
an example of a violation of the write-after read consistency.
16.5 IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA-CENTRIC CONSISTENCY MODELS
Ordered multicasts (Chapter 15) play an important role in the implementation of consistency
models. In the succeeding text, we outline some of these implementations.
Linearizability: Linearizability can be implemented using total order multicast that forces
every replica to process all reads and writes in the same order. Here are the steps:
1. A process that wants to read (or write) a shared variable x calls a procedure read(x) (or
write(x)) from its local server. The local server sends out the read and writes requests
to all other servers using total order multicast.
2. Upon the final delivery of these requests, all replica servers update their copies of x
in response to a write (which signals the completion of the write(x) operation). For
read(x), the replica servers only return acks to the initiating server signaling the appropriate
time (consistent with the total order) to read the copy of x from its local server.
The correctness follows from the fact that every replica sees and applies all writes and reads
in the same order, which reflects a consistent composite trace.
Sequential consistency: To implement sequential consistency, each read operation
immediately returns the local copy. Only write operations trigger a total order multicast.
Following the multicast, other servers update their local copies of the shared
352 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
variables. As a result, every replica sees all writes in the same order, and each read
returns a value consistent with some write in this total order.
Causal consistency: To implement causal consistency, one approach is to use vector time
stamps. As usual, every write request is tagged with the current value of the vector clock
and multicast to all replicas using the causal order multicast protocol (Chapter 15). Upon
receiving these writes, each replica updates its local copy. This satisfies the causality
requirement. Read operations immediately return the local copy, which is consistent with
some write in this causal order.
Eventual consistency: The basic method involves multicasting the updates to all the servers.
Possible methods include flooding the update (expensive in terms of the number of
messages), or using a spanning tree (works for fixed topologies, but failures and frequent
disconnections limit its applicability), or using gossip protocols. The order in which a replica
will see these updates can vary from one replica to another and can potentially lead
to inconsistency that needs to be addressed. One such implementation using the gossip
protocol interlaced with antientropy sessions is discussed in the description of the Bayou
distributed data management service (Section 16.8.2).
Read-after-read and write-after-write: Starting from the initiating server, at each server
where a user has read a data, build an RS with all the reads performed by that user. Along
with data items, the set RS should also be propagated to all the other servers. When the
user logs in at a different server and issues a read request, the server checks if it has received
the most recent set RS and brought the read values up to date. If this is not done, then
the read operation is forwarded to a server that has received the set RS, the reads are performed,
and the updated RS is pulled into that server. Efficiency considerations need some
refinements of these basic steps. For write-after-write, the steps are similar except that the
server maintains (and propagates) a write set (WS) with all the writes performed by a user.
16.6 QUORUM-BASED PROTOCOLS
A classic method of managing replicated data uses the idea of a quorum. A quorum system
consists of a family of subsets of replicas with the property that any two of these subsets
overlap. To maintain consistency, read and write operations engage these subsets of replicas,
leading to several benefits: First, the load is distributed and the load on each replica is minimized.
Second, the fault tolerance improves by minimizing the impact of failures, since
the probability that every quorum has a faulty replica is quite low. This improves the availability
too. However, classic quorum systems do not support partition tolerance, although
in real-life network, outages can partition the replicas into two or more subgroups. In general,
there are two approaches for dealing with such partitions. One approach is to maintain
internal consistency within each subgroup, although no consistency can be enforced
across subgroups due to the lack of communication. Mutual consistency is eventually
restored only after the connectivity is restored. The other approach is to allow updates
in only one group that contains the majority of replicas and postpone the updates in the
remaining replicas—so these contain out-of-date copies until the partition is repaired.
Replicated Data Management ◾ 353
Most quorum systems use the second approach. The size of the subset of replicas
needed to perform a read or a write operation is called the read quorum or the write
quorum. Here is a description of how it works: Let there be N servers. To complete a
write, a client must successfully place the updated data item on W>N/2 servers. The
updated data item will be assigned a new version number that is obtained by incrementing
its current version number. To read the data, the client must read out the
copies from any subset of R>N/2 servers. From these, it will find out the copy with
the highest version number and accept that copy. Figure 16.10 shows an example. For
performing a read or a write operation, the reader or the writer has to acquire exclusive
control of the required number of replicas. For this, as in concurrency control
of transactions, 2PL can be used—a reader will use read locks, and a writer will use
write locks. For any given replica, writers will be granted exclusive rights, but readers
can share the access to a server with other readers. The locks will be released after the
operation is completed or aborted.
It is easy to make the following observations in such a quorum system:
Observation 1: The system is resilient to the crash of f ≤ (N/2)−1 servers.
Observation 2: Since a read lock does not block readers, multiple readers can concurrently
read: For example, in Figure 16.10, one reader can read from the quorum {S0,
S1, S2, S4}, while a second reader can read from the quorum {S1, S3, S5, S6}.
Observation 3: Two different write operations cannot proceed at the same time, so all
write operations are serialized. Furthermore, the intersection of the read quorum and
the write quorum is nonempty, so reads do not overlap with writes. As a result, every
read operation returns the latest version that was written, and single-copy serializability*
is maintained.
* The effect of transactions performed by clients on replicated data is the same as if they had been performed sequentially
on a single set of data items.

(0, 0) and the updated (value, version) is (5, 1).
354 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Observation 4: During a network partition, the component containing the majority of
the replicas will be active. The minority component is brought up to date after the
connectivity is restored. However, in partitioned configurations, the system becomes
more vulnerable. As an example, in Figure 16.10, if {S0, S2, S4} move to a different
partition, then in the majority component, an adversary can crash any single server,
and the replication system stops working.
The original idea of quorum systems is due to Thomas [T79]. The scheme presented earlier
can be further generalized to allow relaxed choices of the read and write quorums. For
example, it is possible to design a quorum-based protocol if the read and write quorums
satisfy the following two conditions:
1. W + R > N
2. W
N >
2
Thus, in a system with 10 replica servers, an example of a possible choice is W = 9, R = 2.
The extreme case of W = N, R = 1 (known as read-one-write-all) is useful when the writes
are very infrequent compared with reads. It allows faster read and better parallelism. The
downside is that write will be impossible if a single server crashes. This generalization is
due to Gifford [G79].
16.7 REPLICA PLACEMENT
There are many different policies for the placement of replicas of shared data. Here is a
summary of some of the well-known strategies:
Mirror sites: On the WWW, a mirror site contains a replica of the original website on a different
server. There may be several mirror sites for a website that expect a large number of
hits. These replica servers are geographically dispersed and improve both availability and
reliability. A client can choose any one of them to cut down the response time or improve
availability. Sometimes a client may also be automatically connected to the nearest site.
Such mirror sites are permanent replicas.
Server-generated replicas: Here, replication is used for load balancing. The primary
server copies a fraction of its files to a replica site only when its own load increases.
Such replica sites are hosted by web-hosting services that temporarily loan their spaces
to a third party on demand. The primary server monitors the access counts for each of
its files. When the count exceeds a predetermined threshold h1, the file is copied into
a host server that is geographically closer to the callers, and all calls are rerouted. The
joint access counts are periodically monitored. When the access count falls below a
second threshold h2(h2 > h1), the file is removed from the remote server, and rerouting
is discontinued. The relation h1 > h2 helps overcome a possible oscillation in and out of
the replication mode.
Replicated Data Management ◾ 355
Client caches: The client maintains a replica in its own machine or another machine in the
same LAN. The administration of the cache is entirely the client’s responsibility, and the
server has no contractual obligation to keep it consistent. In some cases, the client may
request the server for a notification in case another client modified the server’s copy. Upon
receiving such a notification, the client invalidates its local copy and pulls a fresh copy
from the server during a subsequent read. This restores consistency.
16.8 BREWER’S CAP THEOREM
Large-scale web services like high-frequency trading or auction heavily rely on replication
across a vast pool of servers that are geographically dispersed. In an invited talk in the
ACM PODC 2000 conference, Eric Brewer presented a conjecture—that it is impossible
for a web service to provide all three of the following guarantees: consistency, availability,
and partition tolerance (CAP). Individually, each of these guarantees is highly desirable;
however, a web service can meet at most two of the three guarantees. The conjecture was
later analyzed by Gilbert and Lynch [GL02] and is popularly called the CAP theorem. In
this section, we present arguments in support of Brewer’s CAP theorem.
Consistency in this case refers to atomicity as in the ACID properties of transactions.
Consider an auction system in which the current price of an item is x across all servers
as shown in Figure 16.11a. If the price changes from x to x′, then the revised price should
be reflected in all the servers in a bounded time so that linearizability holds. Availability
implies that every request received by a nonfaulty server in the system leads to a response.
Ideally, a web service should be available as long as the network on which they run is up.
Finally, partition tolerance implies that the service should be available even if the system
partitions into two or more disjoint components. This implies that the service will allow the
network to lose arbitrarily many messages sent from one partition to another.
Now, consider Figure 16.11b that shows that as the price of the item is being updated
from x to x′, a communication failure has partitioned the system to two fragments π1 and
π2. For consistency (read linearizability), the new value must be propagated from π1 to
π2; otherwise, a read operation by a client in π2 at a later time will not return the new
value. But clearly, this is not possible. It does not matter if the new value x′ is pushed
from partition π1 or pulled from partition π2. This means that to support consistency and
availability, partition tolerance has to be sacrificed. To tolerate network partition, one can

356 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
however totally disregard consistency or only assure eventual consistency (since the servers
in partition π2 can be brought up to date after the connectivity is restored), which is much
weaker than linearizability. Another possibility is to sacrifice availability—so when a client
logs in at a server in partition π2, the server will send a request to some server in partition
π1 asking for an update. Until that update arrives, the client will be kept waiting. When
the response comes, the value in the server will be brought up to date and consistency will
be restored, but there is no guarantee how long it will take. So, the service will remain
unavailable, although consistency and partition tolerance are guaranteed.
16.9 CASE STUDIES
In this section, we discuss three replication-based systems and study how they manage the
replicas and maintain consistency. The first is the distributed file system Coda, the second
is the highly available service Bayou that is based on the gossip architecture, and the third
is Amazon’s Dynamo.
16.9.1 Replication Management in Coda
Coda (acronym for constant data availability) is a distributed file system designed by
Satyanarayanan and his group in Carnegie Mellon University. It evolved from their earlier
design of the Andrew file system (AFS). In addition to supporting most features of AFS,
Coda also supports data availability in the disconnected mode.
Coda allows clients to continue even when the network is partitioned. Mobile users frequently
get disconnected from the network, but still want to continue their work without
much disruption. Also, network problems and communication failures can cause network
partitions, making some replicas unreachable. This affects the implementation of consistency
protocols, since partitions prevent update propagation. As a result, clients in disconnected
components receive inconsistent values. To sustain operation and maintain availability, consistency
properties will at best hold within each connected component and with nonfaulty
replicas only. If applications consider this preferable to nonavailability of the service, then contracts
have to be rewritten, leading to weaker consistency models. An additional requirement
in disconnected operation is that after connectivity is restored, all replicas must be brought up
to date and reintegrated into the system. There are various schemes to track the recentness of
the updates and to identify conflicts. Coda uses vector time stamps for this purpose.
To maintain high availability, the clients’ files are replicated and stored in volume storage
groups (VSGs). Depending on the current state of these replicas and the connectivity between
the client and the servers, a client can access only a subset of these so-called available VSGs
(AVSGs). To open a file, the client downloads a copy of it from a preferred server in its AVSG
and caches it in his local machine. The preferred server is chosen depending on its physical
proximity or its available bandwidth, but the client also makes sure that the preferred server
indeed contains the latest copy of the file (using the time stamps of the updated copies)—
otherwise, a server that contains the most recent updates is chosen as the preferred server.
While closing the file, the client sends its updates to all the servers in its AVSG. This is called
the read-one-write-all strategy. When the client becomes disconnected from the network, its
AVSG becomes empty, and the client relies on the locally cached copies to continue operation.
Replicated Data Management ◾ 357
Files are replicated in the servers, as well as in the client cache. Coda considers the server
copies to be more trustworthy (first-class objects) than the client copies (second-class
objects), since clients have limited means and resources to ensure the quality of the object.
There are two approaches to file sharing: pessimistic and optimistic. In a pessimistic sharing,
file modifications are not permitted until the client has exclusive access to all the copies. This
maintains a stricter consistency but has poor availability. The optimistic approach allows a
client to make progress regardless of whatever copies are accessible and is the preferred
design choice in Coda. Reintegration to restore consistency is postponed to a later stage.
The reintegration occurs as follows: Each server replica has a vector (called Coda version
vector [CVV]) attached to it—this reflects the update history of the replica. The kth component
of the CVV (call it CVV[k]) of the replica of a file F represents the number of updates
made on the replica of that file at server k. As an example, consider four replicas of a file F
stored in the servers V0, V1, V2, V3 shared by two clients 0 and 1. Of these four replicas, the
copies V0, V1 are accessible to client 0 only, and copies V2, V3 are accessible to client 1 only.
During a time period A, client 0 updates its local copy and multicasts them to V0 and V1, so
the CVV of these versions becomes 1, 1, 0, 0. If client 1 also updates its local copy during a
time period B that overlaps with A and multicasts its updates to the servers, the CVV of client
1’s version in V2, V3 becomes 0, 0, 1, 1. When the connections are restored and the AVSG
of both clients includes all four servers, each server compares the two CVVs and finds them
incomparable.* This leads to a conflict that cannot always be resolved by the system and
may have to be resolved manually. If however CVV(F) = 3, 2, 1, 1 for client 0, and CVV(F) =
0, 0, 1, 1 for client 1, then the first CVV is considered greater than the second one. In such a
case, during reintegration, the CVVs of all four replicas are modified to 3, 2, 1, 1 and replicas
V2 and V3 are updated using the copies in V0 or V1. Coda observed that write–write conflicts
are rare (which is true for typical UNIX environments). The traces of the replicas reflect the
serialization of all the updates in some arbitrary order and preserve sequential consistency.
Coda guarantees that a change in the size of the AVSG is reported to the clients within
a specific period of time. When a file is fetched from a server, the client receives a promise
that the server will call it back when another client has made any change into the file. This
is known as callback promise. When a shared file F is modified, a preferred server sends out
callbacks to fulfill its promise. This invalidates the local copy of F in the client’s cache—so,
to open file F, the client has to load the updated copy from an available server in the VSG. If
no callback is received, then the copy in the local cache is used. However, in Coda, since the
disconnected mode of operation is supported, there is a possibility that the callback may
be lost because the preferred server is down or out of the client’s reach. In such a case, the
callback promise is not fulfilled, that is, the designated server is freed from the obligation
of sending the callback when another client modifies the file.
16.9.2 Replication Management in Bayou
Bayou is a distributed data management service that emphasizes high availability. It was
designed to operate under diverse network conditions, and it supports an environment for
* See Chapter 6 to find out how two vector time stamps can be compared.
358 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
computer-supported cooperative work, such as shared calendars, bibliographic databases,
document editing for disconnected workgroups, as well as applications that might be used
by individuals at different hosts at different times.
The system satisfies eventual consistency, which only guarantees that all replicas eventually
receive all updates. Update propagation only relies on occasional pairwise communications
between servers. The system does not provide replication transparency—the
application explicitly participates in conflict detection and resolution. The updates received
by two different replica managers are checked for conflicts and resolved during occasional
antientropy sessions that incrementally steer the system toward a consistent configuration.
Each replica applies (or discards) the updates in such a manner that eventually the replicas
become identical to one another.
Supporting application-specific conflict detection and resolution is a major feature
in the design of Bayou. A given replica enqueues the pending updates in the increasing
order of time stamps. Initially, all updates are tentative. In case of a conflict, a replica
may undo a tentative update or reapply the updates in a different order. However, at some
point, an update must be committed or stabilized, so that the result takes permanent
effect. An update becomes stable when (1) all previous updates have become stable and
(2) no update operation with a smaller time stamp will ever arrive at that replica. Bayou
designates one of the replicas as the primary—the commit time stamps assigned by the
primary determine the total order of the updates. During the antientropy sessions, each
server examines the time stamps of the replica on other servers. The number of trial
updates depends on the order of arrival of the updates during the antientropy sessions.
A single server that remains disconnected for some time may prevent updates from stabilizing
and cause rollbacks upon its reconnection.
Bayou allows every possible input from clients with no need for blocking or locking. For
example, Alice is a busy executive who makes occasional entries into her calendar, but her
secretary Bob usually schedules most of the appointments. It is possible that Alice and Bob
make entries into the shared calendar for two different meetings at the same time. Initially,
these are tentative. Before the updates are applied, the dependency check will reveal the
conflict. Such conflicts are resolved by allowing only one of the conflicting updates or by
invoking application-specific merge procedures that accommodate alternative actions.
The antientropy* sessions minimize the degree of chaos in the state of the replicas. The
convergence rate depends on the connectivity of the network, the frequency of the antientropy
sessions, and the policy of selecting the partners. The protocols used to propagate the
updates are known as epidemic protocols, reminiscent of the propagation of infectious diseases.
Efficient epidemic protocols should be able to propagate the updates to a large number
of replicas using the fewest number of messages. In one such approach, a server S1 randomly
picks another server S2. If S2 lags behind S1, then either S1 can push the update to S2 or S2
can pull the update from S1. Servers containing updates to be propagated are called infective,
and those waiting to receive updates are called susceptible. If a large fraction of the servers
are infective, then only pushing the update to other replicas may not be the most efficient
* Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorganization of the universe.
Replicated Data Management ◾ 359
approach, since in a given time period, the likelihood of selecting a susceptible server for
update propagation is small. From this perspective, a combination of push and pull strategies
works better. The goal is to eventually propagate the updates to all servers.
The gossip protocol is very similar to the mechanism of spreading rumors in real life.
A server S1 that has recently updated a replica randomly picks up another server S2 and
passes on the update. There are two possibilities: (1) S2 has already received that update
via another server, or (2) S1 has not received that update so far. In the first case, S1 loses
interest in sending further updates to S2 with a probability 1/p—the choice of p is left
to the designer. In the second case, both S1 and S2 pick other servers and propagate the
updates and the game continues. Demers et al. [DGH+87] showed that the fraction of
servers that remains susceptible (i.e., does not receive the update) satisfies the equation
s = e−(1 + p)(1 − s). Thus, s is a nonzero number—as a result, eventual consistency may not be
satisfied. However, as p increases, the fraction of susceptible servers decreases. A change of
p from 1 to 2 reduces the number of susceptible servers from 20% to 6%.
Terry et al. [TTP+95] showed that deleting an item during the antientropy sessions of
Bayou can be problematic: Suppose a server S deletes a data item x from its store and propagates
it as an update to other servers. This does not prevent S from receiving older copies
of x from other servers and treat them as new updates. The recommendation is to keep a
record of the deletion of x, issue a death certificate, and spread it across the system. Stale
death certificates can be flushed out of the system using time-outs.
16.9.3 Amazon Dynamo
Amazon’s Dynamo is a highly scalable and highly available key–value storage designed to
support the implementation of its various e-commerce services. Dynamo serves tens of
millions of customers at peak times using thousands of servers located across numerous
data centers around the world. At this scale, component failures and communication outages
are expected events. In spite of these, Dynamo helps create a reliable system to provide
its clients an always-on experience. The services using Dynamo guarantee a service-
level
agreement (SLA) that reflects the high availability and reliability of the system. The implementation
of the key–value store should satisfy the ACID properties of transactions.
However, for efficiency considerations, such a system sacrifices strong consistency properties.
Conflicts frequently occur, but that does not impact the write operation—conflicts are
resolved during a subsequent read operation.
Each key is stored in a selected set of servers. Dynamo uses distributed hash tables (DHTs)
to map its servers in a circular key space using consistent hashing that is more commonly
used in many P2P networks. The key K to be stored is also hashed using the same hashing
function, mapping it to a point in the circular key space. Let SF and SG be the two neighbors
of key K on the ring. Then all keys satisfying the condition hash(SF) < hash(K) ≤ hash(SG)
are stored in the server SG that is a clockwise neighbor of K (Figure 16.12). Each server thus
becomes responsible for the region in the ring between itself and its anticlockwise neighbor
on the ring. However, the random position assignment of each node on the ring may
lead to a skewed data and load distribution, as it is oblivious to the heterogeneous node
capacities. To address this, Dynamo decided to use virtual nodes that map each physical
360 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
server to multiple points, instead of a single point on the ring. This allows an unavailable
node to shed its load to the available ones with higher capacity.
High availability is achieved by replicating each data on selected servers. The server on
which a key is mapped takes up the role of a coordinator, and it replicates the key across the
next T servers that are its clockwise neighbors—the value of T depends on the reliability
and the accessibility of the servers. Dynamo uses a quorum system: Let W and R be the
write and the read quorums. Thus, for a write to succeed, W out of the T servers must be
updated. A successful read is defined in a similar way.
Vector clocks: Dynamo uses vector clocks to keep track of the history of its multiple versions
of data and resolve conflicts. The multiple versions are generated when the replicas
are updated by different servers at different times. A vector clock is a list (Si, n · i) where Si
is the server id and n · i is a nonnegative integer associated with server i. The vector clock
changes after every write operation on a given object (Figure 16.12b), which helps determine
whether there exists a causal ordering between two versions of an object. Measurements
showed that multiple versions of data are however rare. In a 24 h profile of the shopping cart
service, 99.94% of requests saw exactly one version, 0.00057% of requests saw 2 versions,
0.00047% of requests saw 3 versions, and 0.00009% of requests saw 4 versions.
Implementing write and read: In response to a write request, the coordinator generates the
vector clock for the new version and sends the new version to the top T reachable nodes. If at
least W nodes respond, then the write is considered successful. During a read operation, the
coordinator sends a request for all existing version to the top T reachable servers. If it receives
R responses, then the read is considered successful—the various versions are returned to the
reader for reconciliation, and the reconciled version is written back. Dynamo uses sloppy
quorum that is a variation of the traditional quorum system—T, R, and W are limited to the

first set of reachable nonfaulty servers in the consistent hashing ring—this speeds up the read
and the write operations by allowing them to ignore the responses from the slow servers. In
some of the common configuration, Dynamo used the values (3, 2, 2) for (T, R, W).
Hinted hand off: To maintain the spirit of always write, Dynamo uses hinted hand off. When
a designated server S is inaccessible or down, the write is directed to a different server S′ with
a hint that this update is meant for S. S′ later delivers the update to S when it recovers.
The service level agreement (SLA) is quite stringent—a typical SLA requires that 99.9%
of the read and write requests execute within 300 ms. Dynamo demonstrated that decentralized
techniques can be used to build a scalable and highly available system, and an
eventual consistent storage system can be a building block for highly available applications.
16.10 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The notion of consistency is central to replicated data management. Weaker consistency
models satisfy fewer requirements—but their implementation costs are also lower, so they
are preferred in the design of large-scale distributed systems. This chapter discusses a few
important consistency models that have been widely used in various applications. It is the
responsibility of the application to judge whether a given consistency model is appropriate.
Client mobility adds a new dimension to the consistency requirements. Also, network
partitions complicate the implementation of consistency models—Coda, Bayou, and
Dynamo present three different examples of dealing with fragile network connectivity.
Since the CAP theorem states that the three properties (strong) consistency, availability,
and partition tolerance cannot be implemented in a single system, practical implementations
have to decide which one to forego. Availability is the driving force behind successful
e-commerce systems like Dynamo.
16.11 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
The primary-backup protocol follows the work by Budhiraja et al. [BMS+92]. In [L78],
Lamport coined the term state machine, although he did not consider failures in that paper.
Schneider [Sch90] extended the work by including failures and wrote a tutorial on the topic.
Lamport also introduced sequential consistency [L79]. Herlihy and Wing [HW90] introduced
linearizability in order to devise formal proofs of concurrent algorithms. Gharachorloo et al.
[GLL+90] presented causal consistency and several other relaxed versions of consistency in
the context of shared-memory multiprocessing (DSM). The general architecture of Coda is
presented in [SKK+90]. In Kistler and Satyanarayanan [KS92] discussed the disconnected
mode of operation in Coda.* Client-centric consistency models originate from Bayou and
are described by Terry et al. [TPS+98]. Demers et al. [DGH+87] proposed the epidemic protocol
for update propagation. The CAP theorem was first presented as a conjecture by Eric
Brewer in his ACM PODC 2000 invited talk. Later, Lynch and Gilbert [LG02] analyzed it in
more detail. In the Symposium on Operating Systems (SOSP) 2007 conference, DeCandia
et al. [DHJ+07] presented the architecture of Amazon’s Dynamo.

EXERCISES
16.1 A replication management system uses the primary-backup protocol in the presence
of omission failures. Argue that in the presence of m faulty replicas, omission
failures can be tolerated when the total number of replicas n > 2m.
(Hint: Divide the system into two groups each containing m replicas. With the
occurrence of omission failure, each group may lose communication with the other
group and end up electing a separate leader.)
16.2 Consider two shared read and write objects X, Y and a history of read and write
operations by two processes P, Q as shown in Figure 16.13.
What is the strongest consistency criterion satisfied by the earlier traces?
Briefly justify.
16.3 In traces satisfying causal consistency, different servers can see the concurrent updates
of a shared object in different orders. As a result, the object replicas at various servers
may not converge to the same final state after all updates stop. For example, in the
traces in Figure 16.8, the final values of x will be 10 in server C and 20 in server D. The
causal coherence model attempts to address this problem by requiring that updates of
a given object be ordered the same way at all processes that share the object. Accesses
to distinct objects can still satisfy the requirements imposed by causal consistency.
Present an example to distinguish causal consistency from causal coherence.
Suggest a distributed implementation of this model and compare it with the implementation
of causal consistency.
16.4 Consider two implementations of quorum systems with N = 10 replicas. In the first
implementation, the read quorum R = 1 and the write quorum W = 10. The second
implementation uses R = 4 and W = 8. Are these two equivalent? For what reason will
you favor one over the other? Explain. What is the problem with R = 7 and W = 5?
16.5 Consider a quorum-based replica management system with N servers, a read quorum
R, and a write quorum W:
a. Will sequential consistency be satisfied if W = N/2, R = N/2? Briefly justify.
b. Will linearizability be satisfied if W = (N/2) + 1, R = (N/2) + 1? Briefly justify.
16.6 To prevent an adversary from tampering the quorum system by crashing a few servers,
probabilistic quorum systems specify a probability distribution in choosing the
quorum from a given set. The rule is as follows: If N1 and N2 are two independently
chosen quorums, then prob [N1∩N2 = Ø] < ε.

Now, consider randomly choosing two different quorums of size c n from a
set of n servers. Show that it will satisfy the requirements of a probabilistic quorum
system with c = ln(1/ε).
16.7 Most replicated data management protocols assume that the copies of data reside
at static nodes (i.e., servers). Technological growth now permits users to carry their
personal servers where they keep copies of all objects that are of interest to them.
Some of these objects may be of interest to multiple users and thus may be replicated
at the mobile personal server nodes. Accordingly, update dissemination must find
out which nodes will receive a given update.
Suggest the design of a protocol that will integrate node discovery with update
dissemination.
16.8 In this exercise, we address if the composition of multiple traces preserves certain
forms of replica consistency. Consider a shared queue and two processes P and Q
enqueuing and dequeuing x, y as shown in Figure 16.14. Parts (a) and (b) illustrate
two traces. Trace (c) is the composite trace that combines (a) and (b).
Are these three traces linearizable? What conclusions can you draw from this?

364 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
16.11 Some shared-memory multiprocessors use write buffers to speed up the operation of
the write-through cache memory (Figure 16.15). It works as follows: When a variable x
is updated, the processor writes its value into the local cache C and at the same time
puts the updated value into a write buffer W. A separate controller then transfers this
value into the main memory. The advantage is that the processor does not have to
wait for the completion of the write memory operation, which is slow. This speeds up
instruction execution. For a read, the data are retrieved from the local cache.
If the program in Exercise 16.10 runs on the multiprocessor with the write buffers,
then will sequential consistency be satisfied? Explain your answer.
16.12 Consider the following three schemes for large-scale replica management. For each
of these, find out which two of the three CAP properties hold:
a. Web servers prefer weak consistency. The content of a cached page expires after
a lease of time. Users still use the old content, until they are refreshed by the
source, or the latest data pulled by the user.
b. Quorum-based protocols.
c. Replica update is treated as a transaction and replicas are updated using the 2PC
protocol.
16.13 (Programming exercise) In a building, there are eight meeting rooms, which are
shared by 10 departments on an as-needed basis. Each department has a secretary
who is responsible for reserving meeting rooms. Each reservation slot is of 1 h duration,
and rooms can only be reserved between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Your job is to implement
a shared room reservation schedule that can be used by the secretaries.
Use the following conflict resolution rule: If multiple appointments overlap, the
earliest entry for that slot prevails and others are cancelled. If there is a tie for the
earliest entry, the secretaries’ first names will be used to break the tie. Each secretary
will work on a separate replica of the schedule and enter the reservation request
stamped by the clock time. The clocks are synchronized. Dependency checks will be
done during the antientropy sessions as in Bayou. The goal is eventual consistency.
Arrange for a demonstration of your program.

Self-Stabilizing Systems
17.1 INTRODUCTION
In large-scale distributed systems, failures and perturbations are expected events and not
catastrophic exceptions. External intervention to restore normal operation or to perform a
system configuration is difficult, and it will only get worse in the future. Therefore, means
of recovery have to be built in.
Fault-tolerance techniques can be divided into two broad classes: masking and nonmasking.
Certain types of applications call for masking type of tolerance, where the effect
of the failure is completely invisible to the application; these include safety–critical systems,
some real-time systems, and certain sensitive database applications in the financial
world. For others, nonmasking tolerance is considered adequate. In the area of control
systems, feedback control is a type of nonmasking tolerance used for more than a century.
Once the system deviates from its desired state, a detector detects the deviation and
sends a correcting signal that restores the system to its desired state. Rollback recovery
(Chapter 14) is a type of nonmasking tolerance (known as backward error recovery) that
aims at making the history of the computation correct and relies on saving intermediate
states or checkpoints on a stable storage. Stabilization (also called self-stabilization), on
the other hand, does not rely on the integrity of any kind of data storage and makes no
attempt to recover lost computation but guarantees that eventually a good configuration
is restored. This is why it is called forward error recovery.
Stabilizing systems are meant to tolerate transient failures that can corrupt the data
memory in an unpredictable way. However, it rules out the failure or corruption of the program
codes. The program codes act as recovery engines and help restore the normal behavior
from any interim configuration that may be reached by a transient failure. Stabilization
provides a solution when failures are infrequent and temporary malfunctions are acceptable
and the MTBF is much larger than the MTTR.
The set of all possible configurations or behaviors of a distributed system can be divided
into two classes: legitimate* and illegitimate. The legitimate configuration of a nonreactive
* Legitimate configurations are also called legal or consistent configurations.
366 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
system is usually represented by an invariant over the global state of the system. For
example,
in network routing, a legal state of the network corresponds to one in which
there is no cycle in the routes between a pair of nodes. In a replicated database, a legitimate
configuration is one in which all the replicas are identical. In reactive systems, legitimacy
is determined not only by a state predicate but also by behaviors. For example, a token ring
network is in a legitimate configuration when (1) there is exactly one token in the network,
and (2) in an infinite behavior of the system, each process receives the token infinitely
often. If a process grabs the token but does not release it, then the first criterion holds, but
the second criterion is not satisfied, so the configuration becomes illegitimate. Figure 17.1
outlines the state transitions in a stabilizing system.
Well-behaved systems always remain in a legal configuration. This is made possible by
(1) proper initialization that makes the initial configuration legal, (2) the closure property
of normal actions that transform one legal configuration to another, and (3) the absence
of failures or perturbations. However, in real life, such a system may switch to an illegal
configuration due to the following reasons:
Transient failures: A transient failure may corrupt the system state (i.e., the data memory)
in an unpredictable way. Some examples are the disappearance of the only circulating
token from a token ring or data corruption due to radio interference or power
supply variations.
Topology changes: The topology of the network changes at run time when a node crashes
or a new node is added to the system. These are characteristics of dynamic networks.
Frequent topology changes are common in mobile computing.
Environmental changes: The environment of a program may change without notice. The
environment of a program or a system consists of external variables that it can only
read but not modify. A network of processes controlling the traffic lights in a city
may run different programs depending on the volume and the distribution of traffic.
In this case, the traffic pattern acts as the environment. If the system runs the early
morning programs in the afternoon rush hours, the application will perform poorly,
and, therefore, so the configuration is considered illegal.
Once a system configuration becomes illegal, the closure property alone is not adequate
to restore the system to a legal configuration. What is required is a convergence mechanism

to guarantee eventual recovery to a legal configuration. A system is called stabilizing (or
self-stabilizing) when the following two conditions hold:
Convergence: Regardless of the initial state, and regardless of eligible actions chosen for
execution at each step, the system eventually returns to a legal configuration.
Closure: Once in a legal configuration, the system continues to be in the legal configuration
unless a failure or a perturbation corrupts the data memory.
17.2 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS
Let true be the program of a stabilizing system and Q be the predicate defining a legal
configuration. Using the notations of predicate transformers introduced in Chapter 5, the
condition wp(SSS, Q) = true holds for a stabilizing system. The weakest precondition true
denotes that starting from all possible initial states, stabilizing systems recover to a correct
or legal configuration. This implies that regardless of how the state is modified by a failure
or a perturbation, the recovery is guaranteed.
A closely related version is an adaptive system, where the system spontaneously adjusts
itself by reacting to environmental changes. An example of environment is a variable that
represents the time of the day. Data centers expect different volumes and patterns of traffic
during different times of the day and arrange to provision hardware and software resources
accordingly. A network may compute the shortest path between pairs of nodes regardless of
node crashes—here, the environment crashed(i) (reflecting the crash failure of node i) is a
Boolean variable that the network can only read but not modify. The shortest path computation
adapts to the value of crashed(i). Our previous formulation of a stabilizing system did not
explicitly recognize the role of the environment, but it can be accommodated with a minor
modification. Let S be a system and e be a Boolean variable representing two possible states
(true and false) of the environment. To be adaptive, S must adjust its behavior as follows: when
e is true, S must stabilize to a legal configuration that satisfies predicate Q1, and when e is false,
S must stabilize to a legal configuration that satisfies predicate Q0. These imply that starting
from any initial configuration, S must stabilize to the predicate E = (e ∧ Q1) ∨ (¬e ∧ Q0), which
is formally represented as wp(S, E) = true. This completes the transformation.
Let SSS be a stabilizing system and the predicate Q define its legal configuration.
Consider a finite behavior, in which the sequence of global states satisfies the sequence
of predicates: (¬Q, ¬Q, ¬Q, …, Q, Q, Q, Q). This behavior satisfies both convergence and
closure.
However, a behavior in which the global state satisfies the sequence of predicates
(¬Q, ¬Q, …, ¬Q, Q, ¬Q, Q, Q) is inadmissible, since the transition from Q to ¬Q via normal
program actions violates the closure property.
Finally, we address the issue of termination. Termination reflects a configuration when
the system reaches a legitimate configuration and all guards or actions are disabled.
Stabilizing systems sometimes relax the termination requirement by allowing infinite
behaviors that lead the system to a fixed point, where all enabled actions maintain the
configuration in which Q holds. For our purpose, the behavior (¬Q, ¬Q, …, ¬Q, Q, Q, Q, …)
with an infinite suffix of states satisfying Q will be considered an acceptable demonstration
of both convergence and closure.
368 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
17.3 STABILIZING MUTUAL EXCLUSION
Dijkstra’s work [D74] initiated the field of self-stabilization in distributed systems. He first
demonstrated its feasibility by proposing stabilizing solutions to the problem of mutual
exclusion on three different types of networks. In this section, we present the solutions to
two of these versions.
17.3.1 Mutual Exclusion on a Unidirectional Ring
Consider a unidirectional ring of n processes 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1 (Figure 17.2). Each process
can remain in one of the k possible states 0, 1, 2, …, k − 1. We consider the sharedmemory
model of computation: A process i, in addition to reading its own state s[i], can
read the state s[i − 1 mod n] of its predecessor process i − 1 mod n. Depending on whether
a predefined guard (which is a Boolean function of these two states) is true, process i may
choose to modify its own state.
We will call a process with an enabled guard a privileged process or a process holding a
token. This is because a privileged process is one that can take an action, just as in a token
ring network, a process holding the token is eligible to transmit or receive data. A legal
configuration of the ring is characterized by the following two conditions:
Safety: The number of processes with an enabled guard is exactly one.
Liveness: During an infinite behavior, the guard of each process is enabled infinitely often.
A privileged process executes its critical section. A process that has an enabled guard
but does not want to execute its critical section simply executes an action to pass the privilege
to its neighbor. Transient failures may transform the system to an illegal configuration.
The problem is to design a protocol, so that starting from an arbitrary initial state,
the system eventually converges to a legal configuration and remains in that configuration
thereafter.
Dijkstra’s solution assumed process 0 to be a distinguished process that behaves differently
from the remaining processes in the ring. All the other processes run identical programs.
There is a central scheduler for the entire system. In addition, the condition k > n
holds. The programs are as follows:
Program ring;
{program for process 0}
do s[0]=s[n − 1]→s[0]:= s[0]+ 1 mod k od
{program for process i ≠ 0}
do s[i]≠s[i − 1]→s[i]:= s[i − 1] od

urge the reader to study a few sample runs of the aforementioned protocol and observe the
convergence and closure properties. A configuration in which ∀i, j : s[i] = s[j] is an example
of a legal configuration.
Proof of correctness
Lemma 17.1
[No deadlock] In any configuration, at least one process must have an enabled guard.
Proof: If every process 1 through n − 1 has a disabled guard, then ∀i > 0, s[i] = s[i − 1]. But
this implies that s[0] = s[n − 1], so process 0 must have an enabled guard. ◾
Lemma 17.2
[Closure] The legal configuration satisfies the closure property.
Proof: If only process 0 has an enabled guard, then ∀i, j : 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1 : s[i] = s[j]. A move
by process 0 will disable its own guard and enable the guard for process 1. If only process
i (0 < i < n − 1) has an enabled guard, then
• ∀j < i : s[j] = s[i − 1]
• ∀k > i : s[k] = s[i]
• s[i] ≠ s[i − 1]
Accordingly, a move by process i will disable its own guard and enable the guard for process
(i + 1) mod n. Similar arguments hold when only process (n − 1) has an enabled guard. ◾
As a consequence of Lemmas 17.1 and 17.2, in an infinite computation, the guard of each
process will be true infinitely often.
Lemma 17.3
[Convergence] Starting from any illegal configuration, the ring eventually converges to a
legal configuration.
Proof: Observe that every action by a process disables its own guard and enables at most
one new guard in a different process—so the number of enabled guards never increases.
Now, assume that the claim is false, and the number of enabled guards remains constant
during an infinite suffix of a behavior. This is possible if every action that disables an existing
guard enables exactly one new guard.
There are n processes with k(k > n) states per process. By the pigeonhole principle, in
any initial configuration, at least one element j ∈ {0, 1, 2, …, k − 1} must not be the initial
370 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
state of any process. Each action by process (i > 0) essentially copies the state of its predecessor,
so if j is not the state of any process in the initial configuration, no process can
be in state j until s[0] becomes equal to j. However, it is guaranteed that at some point,
s[0] will be equal to j, since process 0 executes actions infinitely often, and every action
increments s[0] (mod k). Once s[0] = j, eventually every process attains the state j, and the
system reaches a legal configuration. ◾
The property of stabilization follows from Lemmas 17.2 and 17.3.
17.3.2 Mutual Exclusion on a Bidirectional Array
The second protocol operates on an array of processes 0 through n − 1 (Figure 17.3). We
present here a modified version of Dijkstra’s protocol, taken from [G93]
In this system, ∀i : s[i] ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} and is independent of the size of the array. The two
processes 0 and n − 1 behave differently from the rest—they have two states each. By definition,
s[0] ∈ {1, 3} and s[n − 1] ∈ {0, 2}. Let N(i) designate the set of neighbors of process i.
The program is as follows:
program four-state;
{program for process i, i = 0 or n − 1}
do ∃j ∈ N(i):s[j]=s[i]+ 1mod 4 → s[i]:= s[i]+ 2 mod 4 od
{program for process i, 0 < i < n − 1}
do ∃j ∈ N(i):s[j]=s[i]+ 1mod 4 → s[i]:= s[i]+ 1 mod 4 od
Proof of correctness
The absence of deadlock can be trivially demonstrated using arguments similar to those
used in Lemma 17.1. We focus on convergence only.
For a process i, call the processes i + 1 and i − 1 to be the right and the left neighbors,
respectively. Define two predicates L · i and R · i as follows:
L i  s[i −1]:= s[i]+ 1mod4
R i  s[i +1]:= s[i]+ 1mod4
We will represent L · i by drawing a → from process i − 1 to process i and R · i by drawing
a ← from process i + 1 to process i. Thus, any process with an enabled guard has at least
one arrow pointing toward it.
For a process i (0 < i < n − 1), the possible moves fall exactly into one of the seven cases in
part (a) of Table 17.1. Each entry in the columns precondition and postcondition represents
0 1 2 n – 2 n – 1
FIGURE 17.3 An array of n processes.
Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 371
the states of the three processes (i − 1, i, i + 1) before and after the action by process i. Note
that x ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, and all + operations are mod 4 operations.
Case (a) represents the move when a → is transferred to the right neighbor. Case (e)
shows the move when a ← is transferred to the left neighbor. Cases (c) and (f) show how
a → can be converted to a ←, and vice versa. Finally, cases (b), (d), and (g) correspond to
moves by which the number of enabled guards is reduced. Note that in all seven cases, the
total number of enabled guards is always nonincreasing.
Part (b) of Table 17.1 shows a similar list for the two processes 0 and n − 1. Case (h) lists
the states of processes 0 and 1, and case (k) lists the states of processes n − 2 and n − 1.
Process 0 transforms a ← to a →, and process n − 1 transforms a → to a ←. These two processes
thus act as reflectors. Once again, the number of enabled guards does not increase.
Lemma 17.4
If the number of enabled guards in the processes 0..i (i < n − 1) is positive, and process i + 1
does not execute an action, then after at most three moves by process i, the total number of
enabled guards in the processes 0..i is reduced.
Proof: By assumption, at least one of the processes 0..i has an enabled guard, and process
i + 1 does not make an action. We will designate the three possible moves by process i as
move 1, move 2, and move 3. The following cases exhaust all possibilities:
Case 1: If move 1 is of type (a), (b), (d) or (g), the result follows immediately.
Case 2: If move 1 is of type (e) or (f), after move 1, the condition s[i] = s[i + 1] holds. In that
case, move 2 must be of type (a), and the result follows immediately.
Case 3: If move 1 is of type (c), after the first move, the condition s[i + 1]= s[i] + 1 mod 4
holds. In this case, move 2 must be of types (b), (e), (f) or (g). If cases (b) and (g) apply, the

result follows from case 1. If cases (e) and (f) apply, then we need a move 3 of type (a) as in
Case 2, and the number of enabled guards in processes 0..i will be reduced. ◾
Lemma 17.4 implies that if there is an enabled guard to the left of a process i, then after a
finite number of moves by process i, a → appears at its right neighbor i + 1. Using similar
arguments, one can demonstrate that if there is an enabled guard to the right of process
i(i > 0), then after a finite number of moves by process i, a ← appears at its left neighbor i − 1.
Lemma 17.5
In an infinite behavior, every process makes infinitely many moves.
Proof: Assume that this is not true, and there is a process j that does not make any move
in an infinite behavior. By Lemma 17.4 and its follow-up arguments, in a finite number of
moves, the number of enabled guards for every process i ≠ j will be reduced to 0. However,
deadlock is impossible. So process j must make infinitely many moves.
Lemma 17.6
[Closure] If there is a single arrow, then all subsequent configurations contain a single arrow.
Proof: This follows from the cases (a), (e), (h), (k) in Table 17.1.
In an arbitrary initial state, there may be more than one → and/or ← in the system. To
prove convergence, we need to demonstrate that in a bounded number of moves, the
number
of arrows is reduced to 1. ◾
Lemma 17.7
[Convergence] Program four-state guarantees convergence to a legal configuration.
Proof: We argue that every arrow is eventually eliminated unless it is the only one in the
system. We start with a →. A → is eliminated when it meets a ← (Table 17.1, case b) or
another → (Table 17.1, case d). From Lemma 17.4, it follows that every → eventually moves
to the right until it meets a ← or reaches process n − 1. In the first case, two arrows are
eliminated. In the second case, the → is transformed into a ← after which the ← eventually
moves to the left until it meets a → or a ←. In the first case (Table 17.1, case d), both arrows
are eliminated, whereas in the second case (Table 17.1, case g), one arrow disappears and
the ← is transformed into a →. Thus, the number of arrows progressively goes down. When
the number of arrows is reduced to one, the system reaches a legal configuration.
Figure 17.4 illustrates a typical convergence scenario. Since closure follows from
Lemma 17.6 and convergence follows from Lemma 17.7, the program four-state guarantees
stabilization. This concludes the proof.

17.4 STABILIZING GRAPH COLORING
Graph coloring is a classical problem in graph theory. Given an undirected graph G = (V, E)
and a set of colors C, node coloring defines a mapping from V → C such that no two adjacent
nodes have the same color. In this section, we focus on designing a stabilizing algorithm
for coloring the nodes of a planar graph using at the most six colors.
Section 10.4 illustrates a distributed algorithm for coloring the nodes of any planar
graph with at the most six colors, but the algorithm is not stabilizing. In this section, we
present the stabilizing version of it. Readers should review this algorithm before studying
the stabilizing version.
The algorithm in Section 10.4.2 has two components. The first component transforms
the given planar graph into a directed acyclic graph (dag) for which ∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5.
The second component performs the actual coloring on this dag. Of the two components,
the second one is stabilizing, since no initialization is necessary to produce a valid node
coloring. However, the first one is not stabilizing, since it requires specific initialization
(all edges were initialized to the state undirected). As a result, the composition of the two
components is also not stabilizing. Our revised plan here has two goals:
1. Design a stabilizing algorithm A that transforms any planar graph into a dag for
which the condition P ≡ ∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5 holds.
2. Use the dag-coloring algorithm B from Section 10.4 such that the desired postcondition
Q reflecting a valid six-coloring holds.
If the actions of B do not negate any enabled guard of A, we can use the idea of convergence
stairs [GM91] and run the two components concurrently to produce the desired
coloring. We revisit algorithm B for coloring the dag. Recall that
• The color palette C = {0,1,2,3,4,5}
• c(i) denotes the color of node i
• succ(i) denotes the successors of a node i
• sc(i) = {c(j) : j ∈ succ(i)}
FIGURE 17.4 An illustration of convergence of the four-state algorithm.
374 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The following coloring algorithm from Section 10.4 works on a dag G′ for which
∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5, and produces a valid six-coloring of the dag.
program colorme;
{program for node i}
do ∃j ∈ succ(i):c(i)=c(j)→c(i):= b:b ∈{C\sc(i)} od
To recall how it works, note that the leaves of the dag have stable colors. So after at most one
round, the predecessors of the leaf nodes will have a stable color. After at most two rounds,
the predecessors of the predecessors will attain a stable color. In at most |V| rounds, all
nodes will be appropriately colored.
However, the crucial issue here is the generation of a dag G′ that satisfies the condition
P ≡ ∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5. To find a stabilizing solution, assume that initially the edges
of G may be oriented in an arbitrary way (instead of being undirected), and the original
algorithm
of Section 10.4.2 is not designed to handle it! So we present a stabilizing
algorithm
for dag generation.
Dag-generation algorithm: To represent the edge directions, let us introduce a nonnegative
integer variable x(i) for every node i. Let i and j be the ids of a pair of neighboring
nodes. The relationship between x and the edge directions is as follows:
• i → j iff, x(i) < x(j) or x(i) = x(j) and i < j
• j → i otherwise
Let sx(i) = {x(j) : j ∈ succ(i)}. Then regardless of the initial values of x, the following algorithm
A will generate a dag that satisfies the condition ∀ i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤5:
program dag;
{program for process i}
do |succ(i)|>5 → x(i):= max(sx(i))+ 1 od
As in the coloring algorithm, we assume large grain atomicity, so that the maximum
element of the set sx(i) is computed atomically. The proof of correctness relies on Euler’s
polyhedron formula (see [H69]), which was introduced in Chapter 10. Corollary 10.1
established earlier that every planar graph has at least one node with degree ≤ 5. It
remains to show that given an arbitrary planar graph and no initial edge direction specified,
the dag-generation algorithm guarantees convergence to a global configuration in
which the condition ∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5 holds.
Lemma 17.8
The dag-generation algorithm stabilizes to a configuration in which the condition
∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5 holds.
Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 375
Proof (by contradiction): The partial correctness is trivial, that is, if the algorithm
terminates,
then the condition ∀i ∈ V : outdegree(i) ≤ 5 will hold. So we focus on termination
only. Assume that the algorithm does not terminate. Then there is at least one node j
that makes infinitely many moves. Every move by j directs all its edges toward j. Therefore,
between two consecutive moves by node j, at least six nodes in succ(j) must make moves.
Furthermore, if j makes infinitely many moves, then at least six nodes in succ(j) must also
make infinitely many moves. Since the number of nodes is finite, it follows
that (1) there
exists a subgraph in which every node has a degree >5 and (2) the nodes of this subgraph
make infinitely many moves. However, since every subgraph of a planar graph is
also a planar
graph, and there is no planar graph in which the degree of every node is >5
(Corollary 10.1), condition leads to a contradiction. ▪
The combination of the two programs is straightforward. In program colorme, it
may be impossible for node i to choose a value for c(i) when |succ(i)| > 5, since the
set C\sc(i) may become empty. To avoid this situation, strengthen the guard to
( succ(i) > 5)(jsucc(i): c(i) = c(j)), without changing the corresponding action. The
final version is shown as follows:
program six-coloring;
{program for node i}
do {Component A: dag generation action}
|succ(i)|>5 → x(i):= max(sx(i))+ 1
{Component B: coloring action}
[](|succ(i)|≤ 5) ∧ (∃j ∈ succ(i): c(i) = c(j)) → c(i):= b:b ∈ {C \sc(i)}
od
Since the predicate of component A is closed under the actions of component B, the
concurrent
execution of these actions will disable all guards, leading to a configuration
that satisfies
P iV : | succ(i)| 5
and
Q  i, j V : j succ(i), c(i)  c(j)
A drawback of the aforementioned solution is the unbounded growth of x.
17.5 STABILIZING SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL
Spanning trees have important applications in routing and multicasts. When the network
topology is static, a spanning tree can be constructed using the probe-echo algorithm
from Section 10.3.1 or some other algorithm. However, in real life, network topology constantly
changes as nodes and links fail and come up, or their states are corrupted, affecting
the spanning tree. Following such events, the spanning tree has to be reconstructed
to maintain service.
376 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
In this section, we present a stabilizing algorithm for constructing a spanning tree,
originally
proposed by Chen et al. [CYH91]. The algorithm works on a connected undirected
graph G = (V, E) and assumes that failures do not partition the network. Let |V| = n.
A distinguished process r is chosen as the root of the spanning tree. Each process picks a
neighbor as its parent P, and we denote it by drawing a directed edge from i to P(i). By definition,
the root does not have a parent. The corruption of one or more P-values can create
a cycle. To detect a cycle and restore the graph to a legal configuration, each process uses
an integer variable L(0 ≤ L ≤ n). Call L the level of a process—it defines its distance from
the root via the tree edges. By definition, L(r) = 0. Denote the set of neighbors of process i
by N(i). In a legitimate configuration, (1) ∀i ∈ V : i ≠ r :: L(i) < n and (2) L(i) = L(P(i)) + 1.
Once the configuration becomes illegal, all processes (except the root) execute actions to
restore the spanning tree. One action preserves the invariance of L(i) = L(P(i)) + 1 regardless of
the integrity of the relation P. However, if L(P(i)) ≥ n − 1 (which reflects something is wrong),
then process i sets L(i) to n, looks for a neighbor j such that L(j) < n − 1, and chooses j as its
new parent. Note that the condition L(i) = n is possible either due to a corruption of the value
of L(i) or due to the directed edges forming a cycle. Figure 17.5a shows a spanning tree, and
Figure 17.5b shows the effect of a corrupted value of P(2)—a cycle is formed consisting of the
nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 and the directed edges connecting them with their parents. Because of this cycle,
when each node i updates L(i) to L(P(i)) + 1, the values of L(2), L(3), L(4), L(5) eventually reach
the maximum value n = 6. For recovery, a node i with L(i) = 6 will look for a neighbor with
level <5 to designate it as its new parent. In our example, let node 2 choose node 1 as P(2) (since
L(1) = 1). Following this, nodes 3, 4, 5 update their levels, and the stabilization is complete.

Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 377
Correctness proof
We follow the arguments from [CYH91]. Define an edge from i to P(i) to be well formed,
when L(i) ≠ n, L(P(i)) ≠ n, and L(i) = L(P(i)) + 1. In any configuration, the nodes and the
well-formed edges form a spanning forest. Delete all edges that are not well formed and
designate each tree T in the forest by T(k), where k is the smallest value of the level of a node
in the tree. A single node with no well-formed edge incident on it represents a degenerate
tree. In Figure 17.5b, there are two trees: T(0) = {0, 1} and T(2) = {2, 3, 4, 5}.
We now examine how these multiple trees combine into a single spanning tree via the
actions of the algorithm. Define a tuple F = (F(0), F(1), F(2), …, F(n)), where F(k) counts
the number of T(k)s in the spanning forest. In Figure 17.5b, F = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0). Define a
lexicographic order (>) between a pair of tuples F and F′ as follows:
F > F  F(0)> F(0)
or
j > 0 : F(j)> F(j)i < j : F(i) = F(i)
With n nodes, the maximum value of F is (1, n − 1, 0, 0, …, 0) and the minimum value is
(1, 0, 0, …, 0) that represents a single spanning tree rooted at node 0.
The important thing to observe here is that with each action of the algorithm, F decreases
lexicographically. With action 1, node i combines with an existing tree, so F(i) decreases,
but no other component F(j), j < i decreases in value. With action 2, node i becomes a new
tree with a single node, F(n) increases, but F(L(i)) decreases, and F(L(j)), L(j) > L(i) may
increase. Therefore, F decreases. Finally, with action 3, F(n) decreases, but all other components
of F remain unchanged. So F decreases.
With the repeated application of the three actions, F decreases monotonically until it
reaches the minimum value (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which represents a single spanning tree rooted
at node 0. ◾
17.6 STABILIZING MAXIMAL MATCHING
Matching is a well-studied problem in graph theory. Given an undirected connected graph
G = (V, E), a matching M is a subset of the set of edges E, such that no two edges in M share
a common node. A matching M is called maximal, if no other edge can be added to the
set M. If (i, j) ∈ M, then call the nodes i and j partners of each other. To compute maximal
matching, each node i maintains a variable partner whose value has to be chosen from its
neighbor set N(i), or it can be ⊥; the latter indicates that node i does not have a partner.
(i, j) ∈ M implies partner(i) = j (denoted by i → j) and partner(j) = i (denoted by j → i).
In an arbitrary initial configuration, the values of the partner variables may be arbitrary.
A stabilizing maximal matching algorithm should lead the system from an arbitrary initial
configuration to a configuration in which the set M is correctly generated and becomes
maximal. We present here an algorithm due to Hsu and Huang [HH92].
378 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The state S(i) of a node i can belong to one of the following five categories:
1. S(i) = waiting ⇒ (i → j) ∧ (j → ⊥).
2. S(i) = matched ⇒ (i → j) ∧ (j → i).
3. S(i) = chaining ⇒ (i → j) ∧ (j → k) ∧ (k ≠ i).
4. S(i) = dead ⇒ i → ⊥, but every neighbor of node i is in the matched state.
5. S(i) = free ⇒ i → ⊥, but at least one neighbor of node i is not matched.
In a legal configuration, the state of each node is either matched or dead. The stabilizing
maximal matching algorithm is based on three rules.
program stabilizing maximal matching
{program for process i}
do
(i → ⊥) ∧ (∃k ∈ N(i): k → i) → i chooses k (1)
(i → ⊥) ∧ (∀j ∈ N(i): j did not choose i) ∧ (∃k ∈ N(i): k → ⊥) → i chooses k (2)
(i → j) ∧ (j → k) ∧ (k ≠ i) → i rejects j and chooses ⊥ (3)
od
Hsu and Huang [HH92] uses a variant function to prove convergence to a legal configuration.
First of all, observe that if the system is not in a legal configuration, then at least one
of the guards in the algorithm must be true. Define c, d, f, m, w to be the number of nodes
in the states chaining, dead, free, matched, and waiting, respectively. Choose the tuple F =
(m + d, w, f, c) as the variant function. The claim is that F will always increase lexicographically
after each of the actions 1–3 of the algorithm, until a legal configuration is reached:
• Action 1 matches i with j—this increases the value of m by 2. It is possible that due to
this action, some neighbors of i or j change their state from free to dead. As a result,
d never decreases, although f can decrease, so F increases.
• Action 2 changes the state of i from free to waiting, so w increases by 1, while f
decreases by 1. Therefore, F increases.
• Action 3 has two possible consequences: (a) If initially k → l (l ≠ j or i), then i changes
its state from chaining to dead or free (so c decreases by 1, but d or f increases by 1).
Therefore, F increases. (b) If initially k → i, then the state of k changes from chaining
to waiting, but the state of i changes from chaining to free (so c decreases by 2, but w
or f increases by 1). Therefore, F increases.
The maximum value that F can attain is (n, 0, 0, 0)—at this state, the system is in a legal
configuration. Since the closure property is trivial, the proposed algorithm for maximal
matching is stabilizing.
Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 379
17.7 DISTRIBUTED RESET
Reset is a general technique for restoring a distributed system to a predefined legal configuration
from any illegal configuration caused by data corruption or coordination loss.
While distributed snapshot correctly reads the global state of a system, distributed reset
correctly updates the global state to a designated value without freezing the application.
Reset can be used as a general tool for designing stabilizing systems in the following way:
Any process can take a snapshot of the system from time to time, and if the global state
turns out to be illegitimate, the process can reset the system to a legal configuration.
To realize the nontriviality of distributed reset, consider that a system of n processes, each
with an integer variable x. Let x[i] be the value of the x variable of process i. Consider resetting
the system to a global state ∀i : x[i] = 0. Since the operation is not atomic, first, let one process reset
x to 0. By the time another process sets its x to 0, the value of x of the previous process may have
changed based on messages received by its from other processes. By the time the last process has
reset its x to 0, the states of the earlier processes may have changed in arbitrary ways. Whether
the resulting global state is reachable from the reset state via a legal computation is debatable.
In [AG93], Arora and Gouda proposed an algorithm for distributed reset on a system
of n processes 0, 1, 2, …, n − 1. They assume that in addition to data memory corruption,
processes can fail by stopping and fail-stop failures can be detected, but process failures do
not partition the system. The system topology is defined in terms of nonfaulty nodes only.
The components of a reset system consist of two layers of actions, which are distinct from
the main application (called the application layer). The two layers are defined as follows:
Spanning tree layer: Processes first elect a leader, which is a nonfaulty process with the largest
id. With this leader as the root, a spanning tree is constructed. All communications in
the reset system take place via the tree edges only.
Wave layer: Processes detect inconsistencies and send out requests for reset. These requests
propagate to the root along the tree edges. The root subsequently sends a reset wave down
the tree edges to reset the entire system.
The wave layer does not influence the progress of the spanning tree construction, so the
convergence stairs rule guarantees that the concurrent execution of the action of these two
layers guides the reset actions to eventually reach the nodes at the correct time. The actions
of the individual layers are described in the following:
Spanning tree layer protocol: This protocol is very similar to the stabilizing spanning tree construction
protocol described in the previous section, with the added factor that it also guarantees
that the process with the largest id is selected as the root. Each process i has three variables:
1. root(i) represents the root of the tree, and in a legal configuration, root(i) ≥ 1.
2. P(i) represents the parent of node i. Its range is {i} ∪ N(i), where N(i) is the set of
neighbors of i. If i is the root node, then P(i) = i.
3. d(i) represents process i’s shortest distance from the root. When i is the root node,
d(i) = 0, and in a legal configuration, d(i) = d(P(i)) + 1. In a well-formed tree,
∀i : d(i) ≤ n − 1, so d(i) > n − 1 will indicate a faulty value of d(i).
380 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The program for the spanning tree layer is as follows:
{Spanning tree layer: program for process i}
do (root(i) < i)∨
P(i)= i ∧ (root(i) ≠ i∨d(i) ≠ 0)∨
P(i) ∉ {i} ∪ N(i) ∨ d(i)≥ n →root(i):= i; P(i):= i; d(i) = 0
[] (d(i) < n) ∧ (P(i) = j) ∧ (j ∈ N(i))∧
(root(i) ≠ root(j) ∨ d(i) ≠ d(j)+1) →root(i):= root(j); d(i):= d(j) + 1
[] ∃j ∈ N(i):(root(i) < root(j) ∧ d(j) < n)∨
(root(i) = root(j) ∧ d(i) > d(j) + 1) →root(i):= root(j); P(i):= j;
d(i):= d(j) + 1
od
The first rule resolves local inconsistencies. If there is a cycle in the initial graph, then
the repeated application of d(i): = d(P(i)) + 1 bumps d(i) up to n that enables the first guard.
This can also happen due to a bad initial value of d(i). The corresponding action prompts
the process to designate itself as the root, and the cycle is broken if there is one. The second
rule enforces the condition d(i): = d(P(i)) + 1 and corrects the value of root(i). Finally, the
third action sets the value of d(i) to the shortest distance of node i from the root.
Wave layer protocol: The wave layer protocol uses the spanning tree to perform the reset operation.
Once a node locally detects an illegal configuration, it initiates a request for reset that
propagates up the spanning tree edges to the root node. The root, upon receiving such a request,
initiates a reset command that propagates down the spanning tree to the leaf nodes. Each process
I has a state variable s(i) that can have three possible values: normal, initiate, and reset:
• s(i) = normal represents the failure-free mode of operation for process i.
• s(i) = initiate indicates that process i has requested a reset operation. The request
eventually propagates to the root, which then starts the reset wave.
• s(i) = reset implies that process i is now resetting the application program. The root,
upon receiving the initiate command, initiates a reset command that propagates via
the children toward the leaves of the spanning tree. Following the completion of the
reset operation, the leaf nodes return to the normal state, and their parents follow
suit, so that all the processes return to their normal states.
The wave layer uses a nonnegative integer variable seq that tags a specific round in the
reset operation. The steady state of the wave layer satisfies the predicate steady(i) for every i
(Figure 17.6), which corresponds to the following two conditions:
• s(P(i)) ≠ reset ⇒ s(i) ≠ reset ∧ seq(P(i)) = seq(i)
• s(P(i)) = reset ⇒ s(i) ≠ reset ∧ seq(P(i)) = seq(i) + 1 ∨ seq(P(i)) = seq(i)
Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 381
The program for process i in the wave layer is as follows:
(Wave layer: program for process i}
do s(i)= normal ∧ ∃j ∈ N(i):P(j)= i ∧ s(j) = initiate → s(i):= initiate
[] s(i) := initiate ∧ P(i) = i → s(i):= reset; seq(i):= seq(i)+ 1;
Reset the application state at node i
[] s(i)≠reset ∧ s(P(i)) = reset ∧ seq(P(i)) = seq(i)+ 1 →
s(i):= reset; seq(i):= seqP(i);
Reset the application state at node i
[] s(i)=reset ∨ ∀j ∈ N(i): P(j) = i: s(j) ≠ reset ∧ seq(i) = seq(j) →
s(i):= normal
[] ¬steady(i) → s(i):= s(P(i)); seq(i):= seq(P(i))
od
While the first four actions implement a diffusing computation, the last action restores the
wave layer to a steady state. In the example configuration of Figure 17.6, the reset will be
over when the condition ∀i : seq(i) = 3 ∧ s(i) = normal holds. The proof of correctness of
the composition of the two layers relies on the notion of convergence stairs and is formally
described in [AG93].
Application layer protocol: The application layer of process i is responsible for requesting
the
distributed reset operation* by setting s(i) to reset. Any node i for which s(i) = reset resets the
application at that node. In addition, the protocol needs to ensure that when the reset operation
is in progress, no communication takes place between the nodes that have been reset
* We assume that the application periodically runs a detection algorithm to decide this.

in the current round and the nodes that are yet to be reset. To enforce this, a process j will
accept a message from process i, only when seq(i) = seq(j). The rationale is that the resetting
of the local states of the two processes i and j must be concurrent events—however, if a message
is allowed between i and j after i is reset but j is not, a causal chain (i is reset π i sends a
message to j π j receives it ≺ j is reset) can result between the two local resets.
The role of seq is to distinguish between nodes that have been reset and nodes that are
yet to be reset during the current round of the wave layer. While the proposed algorithm
reflects an unbounded growth of seq, it is sufficient to limit the range of seq to {0, 1, 2} and
replace the operation seq(i) := seq(j) + 1 in the wave layer by seq(i) := seq(j) + 1 mod 3.
17.8 STABILIZING CLOCK PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION
We revisit the problem of synchronizing the phases of a system of clocks ticking in unison.
The goal is to develop a protocol that will guarantee that regardless of the starting configuration,
the phases of all the clocks eventually become identical and remain identical
thereafter. Recall that Chapter 6 describes such a protocol—it is a stabilizing protocol for
synchronizing the phases of an array of clocks ticking in unison (Section 6.5). The protocol
uses three-valued clocks, and each clock ticks as 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, … (O(1) space complexity
means that the solution is scalable). The solution has subsequently been generalized to
work on any acyclic network of clocks, as described in [HG95]. Such a solution has two
drawbacks: (1) It uses coarse-grained atomicity, which implies that in one atomic action, a
process can read the states of all its neighbors regardless of the size of the neighborhood
(clearly this is unrealistic), and (2) the solution fails to work on cyclic topologies. In this
section, we present a different protocol for synchronizing the phases of a network of clocks.
This protocol, originally described by Arora et al. in [ADG91], stabilizes the system of
clocks under the weaker system model of fine-grained atomicity: In each step, every clock
in the network checks the state of only one of its neighbors and updates its own state if necessary.
Note that as a process reads the state of one neighbor, the state of another neighbor
may change. Apart from working under fine-grained atomicity, another advantage of the
protocol is that it works on cyclic topologies too, although the space complexity per process
is no more constant.
Consider a network of clocks whose topology is an undirected graph. Each clock c is an
m-valued variable in the domain 0.. m − 1. Let N(i) denote the set of neighbors of clock i
and δ = |N(i)| represent the degree of node i. Define a function next on the neighborhood
of a process i: in each step, next N(i) will return a new neighbor id, and δ successive applications
of next return the starting neighbor. Each clock i executes the following protocol:
program clock synchronization
{program for clock i, j is a neighbor of i}
do true → c(i):= min{c(i), c(j)} + 1 mod m;
j:= next{N(i)}
od
Each clock i will scan the states of its neighbors in a cyclic order and fall back with the value
of clock j if c(i) > c(j); otherwise it will keep ticking as usual.
Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 383
To understand the convergence mechanism of the protocol, consider a clock j whose
value c(j) is the smallest of all clock values in the current configuration. We will call j an
anchor node. Note that the anchor node may not be unique. In each step, c(j) is incremented,
and in at most δ steps, each neighbor of j sets its clock to c(j). Figure 17.7 shows a sample
step of the protocol.
It appears that eventually every clock k will set c(k) to c(j) and the system will stabilize.
The argument is sound if the clocks are unbounded. However, with bounded clocks, there
is one catch—if the value of c(i) for some clock i reaches the maximum value (m − 1), then
at the next step, it may roll back from (m − 1) to 0. As a result, the neighbors of clock i
will not follow previous anchor node j but start following clock i, throwing the issue of
stabilization
wide open.
One can argue that from now on, clock i will act as the new anchor until all clocks set
their values to that of clock i. But in order to prevent the occurrence of the previous scenario
before the system of clocks stabilizes, the condition m > 2δmaxD must hold, where
δmax is the maximum degree of a node and D is the diameter of the graph. This guarantees
that the clock farthest from the anchor clock will be able to set its value to that of the anchor
before any clock rolls over to 0. The stabilization time for this protocol is 3δmaxD. A formal
proof of the protocol and the analysis of its time complexity are available in [ADG91].
17.9 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In modern large-scale distributed systems, the principle of spontaneous recovery without
external help has received significant attention. Such systems are supposed to take care
of themselves as far as possible. A number of related ideas conforming to the basic principle
of self-management are becoming popular: These include self-organization,
selfoptimization,
and self-healing. The distinction among these different concepts is somewhat
blurry. Stabilization guarantees recovery from arbitrary initial states and handles the
corruption of all state variables—in contrast, self-organizing systems appear to restore
the system functionality when processes join and leave a distributed system. A distributed
system may be self-organizing but may not be self-stabilizing: An example is the
P2P network Chord [SML + 02]. A collection of such self-management properties will
enable computer systems to spontaneously regulate themselves much in the same way
our autonomic nervous
system regulates and protects our bodies. This is the essence of
autonomic computing.
Mimicking the behavior of autonomic nervous systems calls for a

large assortment of techniques. For example, systems that are prone to crash frequently
can be given a longer lease of life, via proactive microreboot [CKF + 04] of the critical
components prior to the anticipated crash.
Katz and Perry [KP89] described a generic method of transforming any distributed system
into a stabilizing one using the following approach: (1) Start with a traditional design,
(2) allow a node to collect the global state and check whether the configuration is legal or
not, and (3) if the configuration is illegal, reset the system to a legal configuration. This
approach takes into account the possibility of additional failures during the steps (2) and
(3) by taking repeated snapshots. As long as such failures are not perpetual, eventually the
system is restored to a legal configuration.
An interesting observation in many stabilizing systems is that even if a single process
undergoes a transient failure, a large number of processes may be corrupted before the
system recovers to a legal configuration. As an example, in the spanning tree protocol, the
corruption of the parent variable of a single process affects the routing performance of a
large number of processes, and the recovery can take O(n2) time. Ideally, recovery from a
single failure should be local and should take O(1) time. This guarantee is known as fault
containment and is a desirable property of all stabilizing systems. Another closely related
refinement of the stabilization property is superstabilization—a superstabilizing algorithm
guarantees fast recovery from a single change in the network topology, like the addition or
the deletion of an edge or node in the network. The implementation of fault containment
or superstabilization needs extra work.
Finally, although stabilizing systems guarantee recovery, it is impossible to detect
whether the system has reached a legal configuration, since any detection mechanism itself
is prone to failures leading to a false conclusion. Nevertheless, the ability of spontaneous
recovery from state variable corruption, changing network topology, or changing environments
makes stabilizing and adaptive distributed systems an important area of study in
fault-tolerant distributed systems.
17.10 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
The paper [D74] by Dijkstra initiated the field of stabilization. For this work, Dijkstra
received the most influential paper award from the Principles of Distributed Computing
(PODC) in 2002, and in the same year, the award was named after him. Lamport in his
PODC invited address of 1982 [L82] described this work as “Dijkstra’s most brilliant work.”
The paper has three algorithms for stabilizing mutual exclusion, of which the first one
appears in this chapter. The modification of his second algorithm is due to Ghosh [G93].
Dijkstra [D74] contains a third algorithm that works on a bidirectional ring and uses three
states per process. Dijkstra furnished a proof of it in [D86]. The planar graph-coloring algorithm
follows the work of Ghosh and Karaata [GK93]. Chen et al. [CYH91] presented the
spanning tree construction algorithm. The maximal matching algorithm is due to Hsu and
Huang [HH92]. Arora and Gouda [AG94] proposed the algorithm for distributed reset.
Arora et al. [ADG91] presented the stabilizing clock synchronization algorithm. Herman’s
PhD thesis [H91] provides a formal foundation of adaptive distributed systems—a summary
appears in [GH91]. Ghosh et al. studied fault containment [GGHP96, GGHP07]—a more

comprehensive treatment of the topic can be found in Gupta’s PhD thesis [G96a]. Dolev
and Herman [DH97] introduced superstabilization. Dolev’s book on self-stabilization
[D00] is a useful resource covering a wide range of stabilization algorithms.

compute the maximum number of moves required to reach a legal configuration.
17.2 Consider Dijkstra’s stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol on a unidirectional ring
of size n with k states per process. Show that if k = 2 and n = 4, then the system may
never converge to a legal configuration. To demonstrate this, you need to specify an
initial configuration that is illegal and a sequence of moves that brings the system
back to the starting configuration.
17.3 Consider a bidirectional ring of n processes numbered 0 through n − 1. Each process
j has a right neighbor (j + 1) mod n and a left neighbor (j − 1) mod n. Each process in
this ring has three states 0, 1, 2. Let s[j] denote the state of process j. These processes
execute the following program:
{process 0} do s[0] + 1 mod 3 = s[1] → s[0]:= s[0] − 1 mod 3 od
{process n − 1} do s[0] = s[n − 2] ∧ s[n − 2] ≠ s[n − 1] − 1 mod 3 →
s[n − 1]:= s[n − 2] + 1 mod 3 od

What is the behavior of the system in a legal configuration? [See G91]
17.5 Design a stabilizing algorithm for electing a leader on a unidirectional ring of
processes.
Processes have distinct ids. Each process k maintains a leader variable
L(k). In a legal configuration, L(k) = max, where max is the largest id of a nonfaulty
process existing in the ring. Note that the values of L(k) in different processes may
be badly initialized—this includes the ids of nonexistent processes.
Provide a correctness proof to justify why your solution will work.
17.6 In an undirected graph G = (V, E), the eccentricity of a node i ∈ V is the maximum
shortest path distance of i from any other node of the graph. A node with minimum
eccentricity is called a center of G.
Design a stabilizing algorithm for finding the center of a tree. Whenever the
topology of the tree changes, the center will spontaneously shift itself to the appropriate
node. Your algorithm should start from an arbitrary initial state and reach a
fixed point that satisfies the unique predicate for the center. Remember that sometimes
a tree can have two centers. (See [BGK+99].)
17.8 Given a strongly connected directed graph and a designated node k as the root,
design a self-stabilizing algorithm to generate a BFS tree. In a legal configuration,
each nonroot node i must identify a parent node p(i) from its neighborhood N(i)
such that the node i can send a message to the root using the smallest number
of hops. In an arbitrary initial configuration, these parent variables may be badly
initialized.
17.9 Consider a linear array of processes numbered 0 through n − 1. Let s[j] denote the
state of process j and N(j) denote the neighbors of node j. By definition, each process
has only two states: s[j] ∈ {0, 2} if j is even, and s[j] ∈ {1, 3} if j is odd. Starting from
an arbitrary initial state, each process j executes the following program:
do ∀k: k ∈ N(j): s[k] = s[j] + 1 mod 4 → s[j] := s[j] + 2 mod 4 od
If processes execute their actions in lock-step synchrony (i.e., at each step, every
process with an enabled guard executes its action), then describe the steady-state
behavior of the system.
(Hint: Observe that in the steady state, (1) no two neighboring processes execute their
actions at the same time and (2) maximum parallelism is reached, that is, at least
⌊n/2⌋ processes will change their states simultaneously. Argue why this will be so.)
Self-Stabilizing Systems ◾ 387
17.10 Let G = (V, E) represent the topology of a network of wireless terminals: Here, V is a
set of nodes representing terminals, and E is the set of edges between them. An edge
between a pair of terminals indicates that one is within the communication range
of the other and such edges are bidirectional. The local clocks of these terminals are
perfectly synchronized.
One problem in such a system is the collision in the MAC layer, which is traditionally
avoided using the RTS-CTS signals. Now consider a different solution of
collision avoidance using TDMA: Let processes agree to a cyclic order of time slots
of equal size, numbered 0, 1, 2, …, δ − 1, where δ is the maximum degree of a node.
The goal now is for each process to pick up a time slot that is distinct from the slots
chosen by its neighbors, so that across any edge, only one terminal can transmit at
any time.
Design a stabilizing TDMA algorithm for assigning time slots to the different
nodes, so that no two neighboring nodes have the same time slot assigned to it.
Explain how your algorithm works and provide a proof of correctness.
17.11 Revisit the clock phase synchronization protocol due to Arora et al. [ADG91].
Illustrate with an example that single faults are not contained, that is, a single faulty
clock can force a large number of nonfaulty clocks to alter their states to incorrect
values before stability is restored.
17.12 Some people believe that the property of stabilization is too demanding, since it
always requires the system to recover from arbitrary configurations and no assumption
can be made about initial state. Consider softening this requirement where we
may allow a fraction of the variables to be initialized, while the others may assume
arbitrary values. Call it assisted stabilization.
Show that Dijkstra’s stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol on a unidirectional
ring of size n will eventually return the ring to a legal configuration when (1) there
are (n − k + 1) states (numbered 0 through n − k) per process, (2) the states of the
processes 0 through k are initialized to 0, and (3) the remaining processes start from
arbitrary initial states.

Distributed Discrete-Event
Simulation
18.1 INTRODUCTION
Simulation is a widely used tool for monitoring and forecasting the performance of real
systems. Before building the system, experiments are performed on the simulated model to
locate possible sources of errors, which saves money and effort, prevents possible malfunction,
and boosts confidence. In the area of networking, network simulators are very popular
and widely used. VLSI designers use circuit simulation packages like SPICE to study
the performance before actually building the system. Sensitive safety-critical applications
invariably use simulation, not only to verify the design but also to find ways to deal with
catastrophic or unforeseen situations. Airlines use flight simulators to train pilots. Most
real-life problems are large and complex, and they take an enormous amount of time when
run sequentially on a single processor. Distributing the total simulation among several
processors has the potential to reduce the run time. Although it is conceptually easy, distributed
simulation poses interesting synchronization challenges. In this chapter, we will
study some of these challenges.
18.1.1 Event-Driven Simulation
We distinguish between the real system (often called the physical system) and the simulated
version that is expected to mimic the real system. The correctness of simulation requires
that the simulated version preserve the temporal order of events in the physical system.
Considering the physical system to be message based, a typical event is the sending of a
message m at a time t. In the simulated environment, we will represent it by a pair (t, m).
The fundamental correctness criteria in simulation are as follows:
Criterion 1: If the physical system produces a message m at time t, then the simulated
version must schedule an event (t, m).
Criterion 2: If the simulated version schedules an event (t, m), then the physical system
must generate the message m at time t.
392 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Central to an event-driven simulation are three data components: (1) a clock that tracks
the progress of simulation, (2) the state variables that represent the state of the physical
system, and (3) an event list that records pending events along with their start and finish
times. Initially, clock = 0, and the event list contains those events that are ready to be scheduled
at the beginning. Events are added to the event list when the completion of an event
triggers new events. Similarly, events are deleted from the event list, when the completion
of the current event disables another anticipated event originally scheduled for a later point
of time. The following loop is a schematic representation of event-driven simulation:
{Event-driven simulation: basic steps of a process}
do <termination condition> = false →
Simulate event (t, m)with the smallest time t from the event list;
Update the event list (by adding or deleting events, as appropriate);
clock: = t;
od
As an example of discrete-event simulation, consider Figure 18.1. The customers enter the
bank through door 1. A receptionist (A) of a bank receives customers C1, C2, C3, … and
directs them to one of two tellers W1 and W2 who is not busy. If both tellers are busy, then
the customer waits in a queue.
Each customer takes a fixed time of 5 min to complete the transactions. Eventually, they
leave via door 2. Assuming three customers C1, C2, and C3 arrive at A at times 1, 3, and 5,
the events till time 6 are listed in the Table 18.1. Here, the notation Cn @ v will represent
the fact customer Cn is currently at node v.
As another example, consider the following events in a battlefield. An enemy convoy is
scheduled to cross a bridge at 9:30 a.m., and an aircraft is scheduled to bomb the bridge and

destroy it at 9:25 a.m. on the same day. Unless we simulate the events in temporal order, we
may observe the convoy crossed the bridge—something that will not happen in practice.
This leads to the third requirement in event-driven simulation: The progress of simulation
must preserve the temporal order of events. An acceptable way of enforcing the temporal
order is to respect causality. Criterion 3 elaborates this:
Criterion 3 (Causality requirement) If E1 and E2 are two events in the physical system, and
E1 ≺ E2, then the event E1 must be simulated before the event E2.
Two events that are not causally ordered in the physical system can be simulated in any
order. In sequential simulation, criterion 3 is trivially satisfied if the pending event with the
lowest time is always picked for simulation. In distributed environments, timestamps can be
used to prevent the violation of causal order. If T1 and T2 are the timestamps of the events
E1 and E2, respectively, and T1 < T2, then E2 cannot be causally ordered before E1—so
simulating events in timestamp order is a sufficient condition for preserving criterion 3.
18.2 DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION
18.2.1 Challenges
The task of simulating a large system using a single process is slow due to the large number of
events that needs to be taken care of. For speedup, it makes sense to divide the simulation job
among a number of processes. We will distinguish between physical processes (PPs) and LPs.
The real system to be simulated consists of a number of PPs where events occur in real time.
The simulated system consists of a number of LP—each LP simulates one or more PPs. In an
extreme case, a single LP can simulate all the PPs—this would have been the case of centralized
or sequential simulation. When the simulation is divided among several LPs, each LP
simulates a partial list of events. An LP LPi simulates the events of its constituent PPs at its
own speed, which depends on its own resources and scheduling policies. It may not have any
relationship with the speed at which a different LP LPj simulates a different list of events. In
this sense, distributed simulation is a computation on an asynchronous network of LPs.
The system of tellers in the bank can be modeled as a network of four processes LP1,
LP2, LP3, LP4. Of these, LP1 simulates PP A, LP2 simulates PP W1, LP3 simulates PP W2,
and LP4 simulates PP sink (Figure 18.2). Each LP maintains a local virtual clock that oversees
the progress of the simulation of events assigned to it. The LP corresponding to the
source is not shown. Figure 18.3 shows the event lists for the four LPs.
All correct simulations satisfy the following two criteria:
Realizability: The output of any LP at time t is a function of its current state and all messages
received by it up to time t. No PP can guess the messages it will receive at a future time.
Predictability: For every LP, there is a real number L(L > 0) such that the output messages
(or the lack of it) can be predicted up to time (t + L) from the set of input messages that
it receives up to and including time t.
In the bank example, the predictability criterion is satisfied as follows: Given the input
to teller 1 at time t, its output can be predicted up to time (t + 5). Predictability is important
394 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
in those systems
where there is a circular dependency among the PPs. As an example, consider
the life of a process that alternates between the CPU and the I/O devices: A typical
process spends some time in the CPU, then some time doing I/O, then again resumes the
CPU operation, and so on. The corresponding network of LPs is shown in Figure 18.4. For
simplicity, it assumes that the CPU, the I/O, the input switch S1, and output switch S2 need
zero time to complete their local tasks.
To make progress, each LP will expect input events with times greater than those corresponding
to the previous event. Due to the realizability criterion, no LP can now make
any progress, since the smallest input clock value of any LP does not exceed the local clock
of that unit. The predictability criterion helps overcome this limitation. For example, if the
LP simulating the switch S1 can predict its output up to some time (9 + ε), then it provides
the push needed for the progress of the simulation.
Now, revisit the causality requirement in criterion 3. The virtual clock T of each LP is
initialized to 0. The causality constraints within an LP are trivially satisfied as long as each

LP schedules events in ascending order of its local virtual clock. To satisfy the causality
requirement between distinct LPs, a logical clock value is assigned to each channel in the
network of LPs. Consider a channel from LPj to LPi. Initially, for every channel, clock = 0.
By sending a message (t0, m0), LPj makes LPi aware of all messages sent by PPj to PPi up
to time t0.* As LPj makes progress and sends the next message (t1, m1), LPi interprets that
clock(j, i) has been incremented from t0 to t1. The causality criterion for a single channel is
satisfied by the following chronology requirement:
Chronology requirement: If a sequence of messages (t0, m0), (t1, m1), (t2, m2), … is sent by
one LP to another across a channel, then t0 < t1 < t2 < ….
When an LP receives a message (t1, m1), it assumes that the corresponding PP has
received all messages prior to t1. Only after an LP receives a message (t, m) through
every incoming channel, it simulates the events of the physical system up to the smallest
channel clock time among all (t, m) pairs through the incoming channels and sends out
messages to other LPs. Thereafter, the LP updates its own virtual clock to the smallest
clock value on its input channels. Only a source node can send a message without receiving
any input message. Note that some of these incoming or outgoing messages may be
blank, since there may not be any significant update from a sender or an update to a
receiver. We will address this issue shortly.
The life of an LP LPi can thus be summarized as follows:
{Program outline for a logical process LPi}
Ti:=0{Ti is the local virtual clock}
do <termination condition> = false →
{Simulate PPi up to time Ti}
Compute the messages that PPi would send to each neighbor;

* Ideally, we would specify a time window 〈x,y〉 with each message output. It will signal to the receiving process that the
sender will not send any message with time less than y. For simplicity, we only mention y here.

396 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The termination condition is left unspecified here. If the physical system terminates, then
the simulated system of LPs will also terminate. Otherwise, the simulation may be terminated
based on some other predefined criteria, for example, after a given interval of time
beyond which the simulation results are of no interest to anyone.
18.2.2 Correctness Issues
The correctness of distributed simulation is specified by the following two properties:
Safety: At least one LP must be able to make a move until the simulation terminates.
Progress: Every virtual clock (of the LPs and the channels) must eventually advance until
the simulation terminates.
The safety property corresponds to the absence of deadlock, and the progress (liveness)
property guarantees termination. Depending on how the safety and progress properties
are satisfied, the techniques of distributed simulation have been classified into two types:
conservative and optimistic. Conservative methods rule out the possibility of causality
errors. Optimistic methods, on the other hand, allow limited amount of causality errors
but allow the detection of such errors, followed by a rollback recovery.
18.3 CONSERVATIVE SIMULATION
The life of an LP described in the previous section reflects the principle of conservative
simulation. Causality errors are ruled out, since every LP schedules each event (of
the corresponding PP) at time T after it has received the notification of the simulation
of all relevant prior events up to time T. While this approach is technically sound, it
fails to satisfy the safety requirement, since deadlock is possible. To realize why, revisit
the example of the bank. Assume that for some reason, the receptionist (A) decides to
send all the customers to teller 1. As a result, the clock on the link from the LP simulating
W2 to the LP simulating the sink will never increase, which will disable further
actions by the sink LP.
What is the way out? If an LP does not receive a message through one or more of its
input channels, should it go ahead with the messages from the remaining input channels
and maintain progress? No process can forecast if it will ever receive a message
with a lower timestamp through an incoming channel in the future. One solution is
to allow deadlock to occur and subsequently use some method for deadlock detection
and resolution (see Chapter 9). Another method is to use null messages, proposed by
Chandy and Misra.
A null message (t, null) sent out by LPi to LPj is an announcement of the absence of a message
from PPi to PPj up to time t. It guarantees that the next regular (i.e., non-null) message
to be sent by LPi, if any, will have a time component larger than t. Such messages do not have
any counterpart in the physical system. In the bank example, if at time t the receptionist
decides not to send any customer to W2 for the next 30 min, then the LP simulating A will
send a message (t + 30, null) to the LP simulating W2. Such a guarantee accomplishes two
things: (1) It helps advance the channel clock on the link from the LP simulating A to the LP
Distributed Discrete-Event Simulation ◾ 397
simulating W2 to be updated to t + 30. The local virtual clock of W2 is updated according to
the simulation algorithm, and progress is maintained. (2) It helps avoid deadlock since every
LP is eventually guaranteed to receive a message through each incoming channel process.
Conservative simulation relies on good predictability for achieving good performance: a
guarantee by an LP that no event will be generated during a time window (t, t + L) enables
one or more neighboring LPs to safely proceed with the simulation of events scheduled
between t and t + L. A drawback of conservative simulation is its inability to exploit potential
parallelisms that may be present in the physical system. Conservative simulation is
able to speed up simulation tasks by the parallel scheduling of events that are not causally
related. However, causal dependencies are sometimes revealed at run time. Even if an
event e seldom affects another event e′ or is not likely to affect e′, conservative simulation
will not risk violating the causal order between e and e′, although most of the time concurrent
execution would have been feasible.
18.4 OPTIMISTIC SIMULATION AND TIME WARP
Optimistic simulation method, on the other hand, takes reasonable risks to expedite the
simulation. It does not necessarily avoid causality errors—but it detects them when such
an error occurs and arranges for recovery. The advantage is better parallelism in those
cases in which causality errors are rare. An optimistic simulation protocol based on the
virtual time paradigm is Time Warp, originally proposed by Jefferson [J85]. A causality
error occurs whenever the timestamp of the message received by an LP is smaller than the
value of that of its virtual clock. The event responsible for the causality error is known as
a straggler. Recovery from causality errors is performed by a rollback that will undo the
effects of all events that have been prematurely processed by that LP. Such a rollback can
trigger rollbacks in other LPs too, and the overhead of implementing the rollback is nontrivial.
Performance improves only when the number of causality errors is small.
To estimate the cost of a rollback, note that an event executed by an LP may result in
(1) changing the state of that LP and (2) sending messages to the other LPs. To undo the
effect of the first operation, old states need to be saved by the LPs, until there is a guarantee
that no further rollbacks are necessary. To undo the effects of the second operation, an LP
will send an antimessage or a negative message that will annihilate the effect of the original
message when it reaches its destination LP.
When a process receives an antimessage, two things can happen: (1) If it has already
simulated the previous message, it rolls back. (2) If it receives the antimessage before processing
the original message (which is possible but less frequently), it simply ignores the
original message when it arrives.
Certain operations are irrevocable, and it is not possible to undo them once they are committed.
Examples include dispensing cash from an ATM or performing an I/O operation
that influences the outside world. Such operations should not be committed until there is a
guarantee that it is final. Uncommitted operations are tentative and can always be canceled.
This leads to the interesting question of how to define a moment after which the result of
an operation can be committed. The answer lies in the notion of global virtual time (GVT).
398 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
18.4.1 Global Virtual Time
In conservative simulation, the virtual clocks associated with the LPs and the channels
monotonically increase until the simulation ends. However, in optimistic simulation,
occasional rollbacks require the virtual clocks local to the LPs (LVTs) to turn back from
time to time (Figure 18.5). This triggers a rollback in some channel clocks too.
In addition to the time overhead of rollback (which potentially reduces the speedup
obtained via increased parallelism), the implementation of rollback has a space overhead—
the states of the LPs have to be saved so that they can be retrieved after the rollback. Since
each processor has finite resources, how much memory or disk space should be allocated to
preserve the old states and when these can be deallocated are important issues.
At any real time, the GVT is the smallest among the local virtual times of all LPs, and
the timestamps of all messages (positive and negative) in transit in the simulated system. By
definition, no straggler will have a timestamp smaller than the GVT, so the storage used by
events having timestamps smaller than the GVT can be safely deallocated. Furthermore,
all events older than the GVT can be committed, since their rollbacks are ruled out. The
task of reclaiming storage space by trashing states related to events older than the GVT is
called fossil collection.
Theorem 18.1
The GVT eventually increases if the scheduler is fair.
Proof: Arrange all pending events and undelivered messages in the ascending order of timestamps.
Let t0 be the smallest timestamp. By definition, GVT ≤ t0. A fair scheduler will eventually
pick the event (or message) corresponding to the smallest timestamp t0 for processing, so there
is no risk of rollback for this event. Any event or message generated by the execution of this event
will have a timestamp greater than t0, so the new GVT will be greater than its previous value.
Recursive application of this argument shows that GVT will eventually increase. ◾

Distributed Discrete-Event Simulation ◾ 399
Theorem 18.1 demonstrates that optimistic simulation satisfies the progress property.
Two interesting related questions are as follows: (1) How will the LPs compute the GVT
and (2) how often will they compute it? One straightforward way to calculate the GVT is
to take a distributed snapshot (Chapter 8) of the network of LPs, which takes O(n) time
where n is the number of LPs. Following this, the LPs can free up some space. If the GVT is
infrequently computed, then the fossils will tie up the space for a longer period of time. On
the other hand, if the GVT is computed frequently, then the time overhead of GVT computation
will slow down the progress of simulation. An acceptable performance requires a
balancing act between these two conflicting aspects.
18.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Real-life simulation problems are increasing in both scale and complexity. As a result, the bulk
of the recent work on simulation focuses on methods of enhancing the performance of simulation.
While conservative simulation methods are technically sound and easier to implement,
optimistic methods open up possibilities for various kinds of optimizations that enhance performance.
Application-specific knowledge plays a useful role in maximizing the efficiency.
Performance optimization opportunities in conservative simulation are limited. Good
predictability is a big plus: Whenever an LP sends out a message with a prediction window
L, it enables the receiving LPs to process events L steps ahead. Accordingly, the larger is the
value of L, the greater the speedup.
Lazy cancellation is a technique for speeding up optimistic simulation. If a causality
error immediately triggers the sending of antimessages, then the cancellation is
aggressive, and it is the essence of the original time-warp protocol. As an alternative,
the process may first deal with the straggler and reexecute the computation (by taking
into account the straggler, as if it was received earlier) to check if it indeed generated
the same message. If so, then there is no need to send the antimessage, and many
needless rollbacks at other LPs may be avoided. Otherwise, the antimessages are sent
out. The downside of lazy cancellation is that if indeed the antimessages are needed,
then the delay in sending them and the valuable time wasted in reexecution will cause
the causality error to spread and delay recovery. This can potentially have a negative
impact on the performance.
18.6 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Chandy and Misra [CM81] and independently Bryant [B77] did much of the early
work on distributed simulation. Misra’s survey paper [M86] formulates the distributed
simulation problem and introduces conservative simulation. In addition to the safety
and liveness properties, this chapter also explains the role of null messages in deadlock
avoidance. Jefferson [J85] proposed optimistic simulation techniques. The bulk of
the work following Jefferson’s paper deals with the performance improvement of Time
Warp. For example, Gafni proposed lazy cancellation [Ga88]. Fujimoto [Fu90] wrote
a survey on distributed discrete-event simulation. Further details can be found in his
book on the same topic.

Security in Distributed
Systems
19.1 INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of networking and Internet-based activities in our daily lives, security
has become an important issue. The security concerns are manifold: If the computer
is viewed as a trustworthy box containing legitimate software only, security concerns
relate to data in transit. The main concern here is that almost all these communications
take place over public networks, and these networks are accessible to anyone. So how do
we prevent an eavesdropper from stealing sensitive data, like our credit card numbers or
social security numbers that may be in transit over a public network? How can we preserve
the secrecy of a sensitive conversation between two agencies over a public network?
These concerns relate to data security. Another aspect questions the trustworthiness of the
machines that we work with. Data thieves constantly attack our computing equipment by
sending virus and worms, which intrude our systems and compromise the software or the
operating system—as a result, the integrity of our machines becomes a suspect. Spywares
steal our sensitive data. Trojan horses, in the disguise of carrying out some useful task,
indulge in illegitimate activities via the backdoor. These concerns relate to system security.
This chapter primarily addresses data security—only a brief discussion of system security
appears toward the end. There are six major requirements in security. These are as follows:
1. Confidentiality: Secure data must not be accessible to unauthorized persons.
2. Integrity: Data consistency should never be compromised. All modifications must be
done via authorized means only.
3. Authentication: The identity of the person performing a secure transaction must be
established beyond doubt.
4. Authorization: The user’s actions must be consistent with what he or she is authorized
to do. Unauthorized actions should not be allowed.
404 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
5. Nonrepudiation: The originator of a communication must be made accountable.
6. Availability: Legitimate users must have access to the data when they need them.
To understand these requirements, consider the example of Internet banking. Many of us
do electronic bank transactions through secure channels from the computer at our homes.
Confidentiality requires that your transactions should not be visible to outsiders even if the
communications take place through public networks. Integrity requires that no one should
be able to tamper with your account balance by any means whatsoever. Authentication
requires the system to verify you are what you claim to be and only allow you and nobody
else to access your account. Authorization requires the system to allow you to carry out
those actions for which you have permissions. For example, you can transact money from
your savings account, but cannot modify the interest rate. Nonrepudiation is a form of
accountability that guarantees that if you indeed performed some transactions on your
account (e.g., withdrew a large sum of money on a certain date), you should not be able to
say later: “I did not do it.” This is important for settling disputes. Finally, availability guarantees
that when you need to access the account (say for paying a bill by a certain deadline),
the system should be available. A secure system is useless, if it is not available.
19.2 SECURITY MECHANISMS
Three basic mechanisms are used to meet security requirements. These are as follows:
1. Encryption: Encryption implements a secure data channel, so that information is not
leaked out to or stolen by outsiders.
2. Signature: Digital signatures provide authentication and nonrepudiation and protect
integrity.
3. Hashing: Checksums or hash functions maintain data integrity and support
authentication.
There are many algorithms to implement each of these mechanisms. These mechanisms
collectively implement a security service offered to clients. Examples of secure services are
secure socket layer (SSL) for confidential transactions and secure shell (SSH) for remote
login to your computer.
Secure system design is unrealistic, unless the nature of the threat is known. In the following,
we discuss some common types of security attacks or threats.
19.3 COMMON SECURITY ATTACKS
19.3.1 Eavesdropping
Unauthorized persons can intercept private communication and access confidential information.
Data propagating through wires can be stolen by wiretapping. Wireless communication
can be intercepted using a receiver with an appropriate antenna. Eavesdropping
violates the confidentiality requirement.
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 405
19.3.2 Denial of Service
Denial-of-service (DoS) attack uses malicious means to make a service unavailable
to legitimate clients. Ordinarily, such attacks are carried out by flooding the server
with phony requests. For example, DHCP clients are denied service if all IP addresses
have been drained out from the DHCP server using artificial requests for connection.
Although it does not pose a real threat, it causes a major inconvenience and may cause
revenue loss.
19.3.3 Data Tampering
This refers to unauthorized modification of data. For example, the attacker working as a
programmer in a company somehow doubles his monthly salary in the salary database of
the institution where he works. It violates the integrity requirement.
19.3.4 Masquerading
The attacker disguises himself or herself to be an authorized user and gains access to
sensitive data. Sometimes authorized personnel may masquerade to acquire extra privileges
greater than what they are authorized for. A common attack comes through stolen
login id’s and passwords. Sometimes, the attacker intercepts and replays an old message
on behalf of a client to a server with the hope of extracting confidential information. A
replay of a credit card payment can cause your credit card to be charged twice for the same
transaction.
A widespread version of this attack is the phishing (deliberately misspelled) attack.
Phishing attacks use spoofed emails and fraudulent websites to fool recipients into divulging
personal financial data such as credit card numbers, account usernames and passwords,
and social security numbers. Average citizens are targeted by imposters masquerading for
financial institutions, social networking sites, or Internet auction sites. Statistics [APWG]
show that the fraudulent emails are able to convince up to 5% of the users who respond and
divulge their personal data to these scam artists.
19.3.5 Man in the Middle
Assume that Amy wants to send confidential messages to Bob. To do this, both Amy and
Bob ask for each other’s public key (an important tool for secure communication in open
networks) first. The attacker Mallory intercepts messages during the public key exchange,
acquires copies of these public keys, and substitutes his own public key in place of the
requested one to both Amy and Bob. Now, both communicate using Mallory’s public
key, so only Mallory can receive the communication from both parties. To Amy, Mallory
impersonates as Bob, and to Bob, Mallory impersonates as Amy. This is also known as
bucket brigade attack.
19.3.6 Malicious Software
Malicious software (commonly called malware) gets remotely installed into your computer
system without your informed consent. Such malware facilitates the launching of some of
the attacks highlighted earlier. There are different kinds of malicious software:
406 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
19.3.6.1 Virus
A virus is a piece of self-replicating software that commonly gets attached to an executable
code, with the intent of carrying out destructive activities. Such activities include erasing
files, damaging applications or parts of the operating system, or sending emails on behalf
of an external agent. The file to which the virus gets attached is called the host, and the
system containing the file is called infected. When the user executes the code in a host
file, the virus code is first executed. Common means of spreading virus are emails and file
sharing. Although viruses can be benign, most have payloads, defined as actions that the
virus will take once it spreads into an uninfected machine. One such payload is a backdoor
that allows remote access to a third party.
19.3.6.2 Worms
Like a virus, a worm is also a self-replicating program with malicious intent. However, unlike
a virus, a worm does not need a host. A hacker who gains control of the machine through the
backdoor can control the infected machine and perform various kinds of malicious tasks. The
computers that are taken over are called bots or zombies. The infected computers form a network
called a botnet. Criminals use botnets to send out spam emails, spread viruses, launch
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and commit other kinds of crime and fraud.
Spammers using zombies save the bandwidth of their own machines and avoid being detected.
As of August 2010, an estimated number of 200 billion spam emails were sent per day.
Two well-known worms in the past decade are Mydoom and Sobig. The Sobig worm was
first spotted in August 2003. It appeared in emails containing an attachment that is an
executable file—as the user clicked on it, the worm got installed as a Trojan horse. Mydoom
was identified on January 26, 2004. The infected computers sent junk emails. Some believe
that the eventual goal was to launch a DoS attack against the SCO group who was opposed
to the idea of open-source software, but it was never confirmed.
19.3.6.3 Spyware
Spyware is a malware designed to collect personal or confidential data, to monitor your
browsing patterns for marketing purposes, or to deliver unsolicited advertisements.
Spyware gets downloaded into a computer (mostly by nonsavvy users) when they surf the
web and click on a link used as bait. Examples of baits include pop-ups asking the user
to claim a prize, or offer a substantially discounted airfare to a top destination, or invite
the user to visit an adult site. Users may even be lured away to download free spywareprotection
software. The baits are getting refined every day. Unlike virus, spyware does not
replicate itself or try to infect other machines. Spyware does not delete files, and consumes
a fraction of the bandwidth causing it to run slower.
19.4 ENCRYPTION
The Old Testament (600 BC) mentions the use of reversed Hebrew alphabets to maintain
secrecy of message communication. Modern cryptography dates back to the days of Julius
Caesar who used simple encryption schemes to send love letters. The essential components
of a secure communication using encryption are shown in Figure 19.1. Here,
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 407
Plaintext = raw text or data to be communicated.
Ciphertext = encrypted version of the plaintext.
Key = the secret code used to encrypt the plaintext. No one can decipher or decrypt the
ciphertext without having the appropriate key for it.
Caesar’s encryption method was as follows: Substitute each letter of the English alphabet
by a new letter k placed ahead of it. Thus, when k = 3 (which is what Caesar used) “A” in
plaintext will become “D” in the ciphertext, and “Y” in plaintext will become “B” in the
ciphertext (the search rolls back to the beginning), and so on. Formally, we can represent
the encryption and decryption mechanisms (with key k) as two functions:
E L L k
D L L k
k
k
: ( )mod
: ( )mod
 +
 −
26
26
where L denotes the numerical index of a letter and 0 ≤ L ≤ 25. Such ciphers are called
substitution ciphers.
Unfortunately, such an encryption scheme provides very little secrecy, as any motivated
puzzle solver can decrypt the ciphertext in a few minutes. Nontrivial cryptographic technique
should therefore have a much more sophisticated encryption scheme, so that no intruder or
eavesdropper can find any clue about the encryption method, nor can he use a machine to
systematically try out a series of possible decryption methods within a relatively short period
of time. Note that given enough time, any ciphertext can be deciphered by an intruder using
a systematic method of attack. The larger this time is, the more secure is the encryption.

The decryption function Dk2 is the inverse of the encryption function Ek1 (denoted as Ek1
−1)
and vice versa. A cryptosystem is called symmetric, if both parties share the same key for
encryption and decryption. Otherwise, the cryptosystem becomes asymmetric.
19.5 SECRET KEY CRYPTOSYSTEM
Secret key cryptosystem (also known as private key cryptosystem) is a symmetric cryptosystem.
It consists of an encryption function E, a decryption function D (the inverse of E),
and a secret key k that is shared between the sender and the receiver. The functions E and D
need not be secret. All that is required is for the two parties to agree upon a secret key
before the communication begins. There are numerous examples of secret key cryptosystems.
We classify these into two different types: block ciphers and stream ciphers. In block
ciphers, the data are first divided into fixed size blocks before encryption. This is applicable,
when the data to be sent are available in its entirety before communication begins.
In contrast, stream ciphers are used for transmitting real-time data that are spontaneously
generated, for example, voice data.
19.5.1 Confusion and Diffusion
According to Shannon [S49], confusion and diffusion are the two cornerstones of secretkey
cryptography. To break a code, one of the important tools for a cryptanalyst is to make
use of the frequency of letters or phrases in human-readable messages. This is called a
statistical attack. Two kinds of statistics are useful in launching attacks: In the first, the
cryptanalyst has access to several ciphertexts of messages using the same key, but does
not have access to the plaintext. In the second, the cryptanalyst has access to both the
plaintext and the ciphertext of messages using the same key. Diffusion spreads the influence
of each bit of the plaintext over several bits of the ciphertext. Thus, changing a small
part of the plaintext affects a large number of bits of the ciphertext. This dissipates the
statistical structure of the plaintext, making it difficult for the statisticians to utilize the
statistics by analyzing the ciphertext. As an example, let Y = y0y1y2...ym−1 be the ciphertext
for the plaintext X = x0x1x2…xm−1, each x and y being the indices of letters from the English
alphabet. An encryption mechanism may use the function y j x j k

to
implement diffusion. An intruder will need many more ciphertexts (compared that in
a simple Caesar-like substitution cipher) to launch a meaningful statistical attack on the
cipher and discover the key.
Confusion, on the other hand, makes the relationship between the key and the ciphertext
as complex as possible. Caesar cipher that replaced each letter by k letters ahead of it is
a simple example of confusion—perhaps too simple for a modern adversary. Confusion is a
complex form of substitution where every bit of the key influences a large number of bits of
the ciphertext. In an effective confusion, each bit of the ciphertext depends on several parts
of the key, so much so that the dependence appears to be random to an intruder. Even if the
statistics about the plaintext is known, the complex use of the key makes it very hard for a
cryptanalyst to deduce it.
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 409
Traditional cryptography implements confusion using substitution boxes (S-boxes).
A (p × q) S-box takes p bits from the input and coverts it into q bits of output, often using
a lookup table. Table 19.1 illustrates a lookup table for a (6 × 4) S-box. The row headings
are the pairs consisting of the first and the last bits, and the column headings represent the
middle 4 bits of the input.
Using this table, the 6-bit input 100100 is transformed as follows: The outer bit pair is 10,
and the middle bits are 0010, so the output is 0001.
In block ciphers, diffusion propagates changes in one block to the other blocks.
Substitution itself diffuses the data within one block. To spread the changes into the other
blocks, permutation is used. In an ideal block cipher, a change of even a single plaintext
bit will change every ciphertext bit with probability 0.5, which means that about half of
the output bits should change for any possible change of a bit in an input block. Thus, the
ciphertext will appear to have changed at random even between related message blocks.
This will hide message relationships that can potentially be used by a cryptanalyst. This
kind of diffusion is a necessary, but not a sufficient requirement good block cipher.
Block ciphers implement confusion by mapping each block of plaintext to the same block
of ciphertext. Without a diffusion mechanism, an attacker can recognize such repetitions,
do a frequency analysis, and infer the plaintext. Cipher block chaining (CBC) is a diffusion
mechanism that overcomes this problem. Let P0,P1,P2,… be the blocks of the plaintext and
Ek be the encryption function. Then CBC encrypts the plaintext as follows:

19.5.2 DES
Data encryption standard (DES) is a secret-key encryption scheme developed by IBM
(under the name Lucifer) in 1977. In DES, the plaintext is divided into 64-bit blocks. Each
such block is converted into a 64-bit ciphertext using a 56-bit key. The conversion mechanism
is outlined in Figure 19.2. The plaintext, after an initial permutation, is fed into a
cascade of 16 stages. A 56-bit secret master key is used to generate 16 keys, one for each
TABLE 19.1 Lookup Table of a (6 × 4) S-Box
0000 0001 0010 … 1111
00 0010 1100 0100 … 1001

11 1011 0010 1100 … 0110
Note: The rows represent the outer bits of the input, the columns
represent the middle bits of the input, and the
entries in the matrix represent the output bits.
410 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
stage of the cascade. The right half of stage (k − 1) (k > 0) becomes the left half of stage k
(diffusion), but the left half undergoes a transformation (confusion) before it is used as the
right half of the next stage. This transformation uses a special function F (which is not a
secret function) and a 48-bit key derived from the 56-bit secret master key. The output of
the final stage (i.e., stage 15) is once more permuted to generate the ciphertext.
A blind attack by a code breaker will require on an average 255 trials (half of 256) to find
out the secret key. However, with the rapid improvement in the speed of computers and
with the collective effort by a set of machines running in parallel, DES does not provide
enough security against a desperate code breaker—blind attacks can crack the code in a
reasonable short period of time. For example, the winner of the RSA Challenge II contest in
1998 cracked DES in 56 h using a supercomputer. In 1999, distributed.net partnering with
Electronic Frontier Foundation won Challenge III and cracked DES in 22 h. With today’s
technology, for an investment of less than a few thousand dollars, dedicated hardware can
be built to crack DES in less than an hour. Government agencies ruled DES as out of date
and unsafe for financial applications. Longer keys are needed.
A major challenge in secret key encryption is the distribution of the secret key among
legitimate users. The distribution of the secret key itself requires a secure channel (e.g.,
by registered post or through a trusted courier). The recipient should know ahead of time
when the key is being sent. The problem of communicating a large message in secret is
reduced to communicating a small key in secret. In fact, key distribution is one of the
major impediments behind the use of secret-key encryption. Another concern is the large
number of keys that need to be used in a network with a large number of users. Note that
for confidentiality, every pair of communicating users needs to have a unique secret key.
This means that in a network with n users, n(n − 1)/2 keys will be needed, and for a large
XOR

network, the cost of distributing them could be prohibitive. In Section 19.10, we will discuss
how an authentication server (AS) can distribute the keys to its clients.
19.5.3 3DES
3DES or Triple DES is a refinement of DES designed to reduce its vulnerability against
brute-force attacks. It applies the DES transformation three times in succession (encrypt–
decrypt–encrypt) using three separate 64-bit secret keys k1, k2, k3 to generate the ciphertext
C from a plaintext P:
C Ek Dk Ek P = 3( 2( 1( )))
3DES reuses DES implementations for the sake of efficiency. It has been shown that against
brute-force attacks, 3DES provides resilience equivalent to a 112-bit key version of DES.
However, the conversion in DES is slow, and that in 3DES is painstakingly slow. These days,
3DES is considered a legacy encryption algorithm.
Several other symmetric cryptosystems use 128-bit keys. These include tiny encryption
algorithm (TEA) by Wheeler and Needham [WN94] and international data encryption
algorithm (IDEA) due to Lai and Massey [LM90]. Blowfish is an encryption mechanism
designed by Schneier—it uses a variable size key of 32–448 bits. Another symmetric
encryption mechanism designed by Schneier et al. [SKW+98] is Twofish with a 128-bit key.
The advanced encryption standard (AES) eventually superseded all these, and it has been
accepted as the US government’s symmetric encryption standard.
19.5.4 AES
NIST ran a public process to choose a successor of DES and 3DES. Of the many submissions
(Twofish was one of them), they chose Rijndael developed by two Belgian cryptographers
Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. A restricted version of this is now known as the
AES. The AES is a block cipher with a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192,
or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with key and block sizes in any multiple of
32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits and a maximum of 256 bits.
The US government approved the use of 128-bit AES to protect classified information
up to the secret level. Top secret information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key
lengths. However, the National Security Agency (NSA) must certify these implementations
before they become official.
19.5.5 One-Time Pad
A one-time pad is a secret cryptosystem in which each secret key expires after a single use.
Also called the Vernam cipher, one-time pad uses a string of bits generated completely
at random. The length of the keystream is the same as that of the plaintext message. The
random string is combined with the plaintext using bitwise XOR operation to produce
the ciphertext. Since the entire keystream is randomly generated, an eavesdropper with
unlimited computational resources can only guess the plaintext if he sees the ciphertext.
Such a cipher is provably secure, and the analysis of one-time pad provides some insight
into modern cryptography.
412 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Despite being provably secure, one-time pad introduces serious key-management problems.
Users who started out at the same physical location, but later separated, have used onetime
pads. One-time pads have been popular among spies carrying out covert operations.
19.5.6 Stream Ciphers
Stream ciphers are primarily used to encrypt real-time data that are spontaneously generated.
The encryption takes place on smaller size data units. Stream ciphers were developed
as an approximation to the mechanism of the one-time pad. While contemporary stream
ciphers are unable to provide the satisfying theoretical security of the one-time pad, they
are at least practical. Stream data are encrypted by first generating a keystream of a very
large size using a pseudorandom number generator and then XORing it with data bits from
the plaintext. These pseudorandom numbers have very large periods and often serve as
a good approximation for the perfect random number required in a one-time pad. If the
recipient knows the keystream, then she can decipher it by XORing the key stream with
the ciphertext (for any data bit b and keystream bit k, the ciphertext is b ⊕ k, and b ⊕ k ⊕ k = b
returns the plaintext.)
The pseudorandom number generator is seeded with a key, and the keystream is the
output of the pseudorandom number generator. To generate identical random keystreams,
both senders and receivers use the same random number generator and identical seeds.
This is a lightweight security mechanism targeted for mobile devices. The keystream can
be computed using known plaintext attacks: The XOR of a known plaintext b and its corresponding
ciphertext b ⊕ k reveals the keystream.
RC4: Designed by Ron Rivest of RSA Security, RC4 is a stream cipher optimized for fast
software implementation. The encryption mechanism uses a 256-byte array R and runs in
three phases:
1. Choose a 40–256-bit key. The length of a key is the number of bytes in the key.
2. Initialize register R using the chosen key.
3. Generate the keystream, a pseudorandom sequence of bits.
This keystream will be used to encrypt the plaintext. The scheme is illustrated in Figure
19.3. The first step is to initialize a byte array R as follows:
program Initialization of R
define R: 256-byte array, key: array of bits, j,k: integer
initially ∀i:0 ≤ i ≤ 255::R[i]:= i;
j:=0; k:= 0;
do k ≤ 255 →
j:=(j+R[k]+key[k mod length(key)])mod 256
swap(R[j],R[k])
k:= k +1
od
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 413
To generate the keystream, the byte array R is associated with two pointers p and q. After
R is initialized, the following program generates the keystream:
program generation of the keystream in RC4
define R: 256-byte array, k: byte
p,q : pointer variables initialized to 0
do true →
p := p + 1 mod 256
q := q + R[p] mod 256;
swap (R[p],R[q]);
k := R[R[p]+R[q]mod 256] {k is the output}
{k is XORed with the plaintext byte to generate the ciphertext byte}
od
RC4 is used in the implementations of SSL/(Transport Layer Security) TLS, WEP (for
wireless networks), and several other applications. In 2013, however, a new analysis
showed how RC4 can be broken [ABP+13], and the impact of this weakness is being
investigated.
19.5.7 Steganography
In Greek, steganography means covered writing. It is the technique of hiding the actual
communication in the body of an inconspicuous sentence or a paragraph. Unlike encryption
where the transmitted ciphertext is incomprehensible and meaningless to an outsider,
the transmitted text in steganography has a valid, but different meaning.
In [K67], Kahn quotes an example of a message [K96] that was actually sent by the
German embassy to Berlin during WWI:
Apparently neutral’s protest is thoroughly discounted and ignored.
Isman hard hit. Blockade issue affects pretext for embargo on byproducts, ejecting
suets and vegetable oils.
Now, take the second letter in each word, the following message emerges:
Pershing sails from NY June 1.
0 1 254 255
p q
Keystream
+
R[p] R[q]
Register R
FIGURE 19.3 The encryption mechanism in RC4 stream cipher.
414 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The transmitted message is called a stego-text. In modern times, some use spams as stegotexts
to embed hidden message. Note that embedding the plaintext inside a text message
is not the only possibility—there are other techniques too. For example, embedding the
secret message inside a picture is another popular approach. Consider a GIF image that
is a string of pixels—one can hide the plaintext in the LSB of the pixels of the image.
Such an embedding will cause no appreciable alteration in the appearance of the picture.
Retrieving the plaintext from the stego-text is quite straightforward.
While cryptography is popular in implementing secure channels, an important application
of steganography is in digital watermarking, used for copyright protection and plagiarism
detection. When the copyright (or the author’s identity) is embedded in the body of
the document using steganography, a plagiarized copy of the original document will easily
reveal the author’s true identity and expose plagiarism.
Steganography is not intended to replace cryptography, but supplement it. Concealing a
message using steganographic methods reduces the chance of that message being detected.
However, if the message is also encrypted, then it provides another layer of security.
19.6 PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOSYSTEMS
The need for a secure channel to distribute the secret conversation key between any two
communicating parties is a major criticism against the secret-key encryption scheme.
Public-key cryptosystems overcome this problem. In public-key cryptography, each user
has two keys: e and d. The encryption key e is posted in the public domain, so we will call
it a public key. Only the decryption key d is kept secret. No secret key is shared between its
owner and any other party. The encryption function (E) and the decryption function (D)
are not secret either. The main features of public-key encryption are as follows:
1. The plaintext P = Dd(Ee(P)).
2. The functions E and D are easily computable.
3. It is impossible to derive d from e. So public knowledge of e is not a security threat.
Diffie and Hellman’s work [DH76] laid the foundation of public-key cryptography. To understand
this scheme, we first explain what a one-way function (also called a trapdoor function)
is. A function y = f(x) is called a one-way function, if it is easy to compute y from x, but it is
computationally intractable to determine x from y (even if f is known), unless a secret code
is known. For example, it is easy to multiply two large prime numbers (>200 digits), but it
is computationally intractable to find the prime factors of a large number containing more
than 200 digits. Trapdoor functions are the cornerstones of public-key cryptography.
The next section explains the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) cryptography that is the
most popular version of public-key cryptography so far.
19.6.1 Rivest–Shamir–Adleman Cryptosystem
RSA encryption starts with the choice of an appropriate integer N = s × t, s and t
being two large prime numbers. The plaintext is divided into equal-sized blocks of k bits
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 415
(k is between 512 and 1024), and the numerical value P of each block is less than N. The
integer N is publicly known. The pair of encryption and the decryption keys (e and d) are
chosen using the following steps.
1. Choose a decryption key d, such that d and (s − 1) × (t − 1) are relative primes.
2. Choose e such that (e × d) mod (s − 1) × (t − 1) = 1.
Once the keys are chosen, the encryption and the decryption functions for each block are
as follows (C = ciphertext, P = plaintext):
C = Pe modN (19.1)
P C N = d mod (19.2)
Here is a sample calculation. Choose N = 143, which is the product of two primes s = 11
and t = 13. Then, (s − 1) × (t − 1) = 123. We choose d = 7 since 7 and 120 are relative primes.
The smallest value of e that can satisfy the equation (e × 7) mod 120 = 1 is 103. So, a possible
pair of keys in this case is (103, 7).
Proof of RSA encryption
We first show that if C = Pe mod N, then the plaintext P can indeed be retrieved from the
ciphertext C using the formula P = Cd mod N. Let Φ(N) be the number of positive integers
that are (1) less than N and (2) relatively prime to N. Thus, if N = 12, then Φ(N) = 4 (since
there are four integers 1, 5, 7, 11 that are relatively prime to 12). Clearly, for any prime number
p > 2, Φ(p) = p − 1. The function Φ is called Euler’s totient function. The following two
are important theorems from number theory:
Theorem 19.1
For any integer p that is relatively prime to N, pΦ(N) = 1 mod N.
Theorem 19.2
If N = p × q, then Φ(N) = Φ(p) × Φ(q).
Since N = s × t and s and t are prime numbers, using Theorem 19.2,

Since s is a prime, using Theorem 19.1,

So, mod {where is an integer} ( )( ) P s r r s−1 t −1 =1
Similarly, mod ( )( ) P t r s−1 t −1 =1
Therefore, mod( ) mod ( )( ) P st N r s−1 t −1 = × = 1 1 (19.3)

The encryption key is posted in the public domain. Only the decryption key is kept secret.
Therefore, only the authorized recipient (who has the decryption key) can decipher the
encrypted message, which guarantees confidentiality. In fact, due to the symmetry, the two
keys are interchangeable.
The confidentiality is based on the fact that given e and N, it is not possible to derive d,
since it requires the knowledge of the prime factors of N. The size of N makes it computationally
intractable for the intruder to determine s and t from N and thus to break the codes. This
is a classic example of a one-way function that makes RSA a secure cipher. If somebody could
design an efficient algorithm to find the factors of a huge integer, then RSA cipher could be
broken. By combining the power of the state-of-the-art supercomputers (like those in NSA
or FBI), 512-bit numbers can be factored in a reasonable time. Thus, to assure the security
of the RSA cipher, the key length should be chosen sufficiently larger than that. Currently, a
value of N in excess of 10200 (i.e., more than 800 bits) is recommended to guarantee security.
The speed of encryption and decryption is an important issue in real applications.
Knuth presented an efficient algorithm for computing C = Pe mod N. Let e = ekek−1ek−2…
e2e1e0 be the (k + 1)-bit binary representation of the encryption key. Then, Knuth’s exponential
algorithm for efficiently computing C is as follows:
program Knuth’s algorithm for RSA encryption
define P: plaintext, C: ciphertext, e:=(k + 1)-bit encryption key
C : = 1; i:= k;
do k ≠ 0 →
C:= C2 mod N;
if ei = 1 → C:= C × P mod N[] ei = 0 → skip fi;
k:= k − 1
od
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 417
Note that this algorithm requires at most k = log2e multiplications, instead of e multiplications
that a straightforward computation of C would require. Due to the symmetry, a
similar algorithm can be used for decryption.
19.6.2 ElGamal Cryptosystem
In 1984, ElGamal presented a new public-key encryption scheme. Unlike RSA encryption
whose security relies on the difficulty of factoring large primes, the security of ElGamal
encryption relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem. We first present
a brief overview of the discrete logarithm problem.
Consider modulo arithmetic, specifically numbers mod q where q is a prime number.
Take another positive integer g(g < q), and compute gx mod q for various positive values
of x. If these values are uniformly distributed in the set {0,1,2,3,…,q − 1}, then g is
called a generator. For example, consider q = 17 and g = 3, and verify that the values of
3x mod 17 are uniformly distributed in the set {0,1,2,3,…,16}. Here, 3 is a generator of the
multiplicative cyclic group {0,1,2,3,…,16}. The discrete logarithm problem asks the question:
If gx mod q = y and the values of q, g, y are all given, then compute x. For example,
319 mod 17 = 10, but determining what value x will satisfy the equation 3x mod 17 = 10
is not an easy problem.* Particularly, when the prime q is 200 digits long, or even longer,
the problem becomes almost intractable. This intractability is the cornerstone of
ElGamal cryptosystem.
Let G be a cyclic group {0,1,2,3,…,q − 1} and g be the generator of that group. To receive
a message from Bob, Amy will randomly pick a number d from G as her secret key. She will
then compute h = gd mod q and publish her public key e as (g, q, h). Bob will learn the public
key of Alice.
To secretly send a plaintext message block P(0 ≤ P ≤ q − 1) to Alice, Bob will randomly
pick a number y from G. He will then compute C1 = gy mod q, and C2 = P ⋅ hy mod q, and
send the ciphertext C = 〈C1,C2〉 to Alice. Note that the length of C is double the length of
the plaintext.
Amy will decrypt C and retrieve the plaintext by computing C C d

indeed retrieves the original plaintext P, observe that

The encryption scheme could be broken if one could derive Alice’s secret key d from her
public key e = (g,q,h), given that h = gd mod q and g,q,h publicly known. However, for very
large q, this is the intractable part in the computation of discrete logarithm! Note that
ElGamal encryption is probabilistic, in as much as a single plaintext can be encrypted to
many possible ciphertexts depending on the choice of h.
* There may be multiple solutions.
418 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
19.7 DIGITAL SIGNATURES
Digital signatures preserve the integrity of a document and the identity of the author.
Signed documents are believed to be (1) authentic, (2) unforgeable, and (3) nonrepudiable.
Consider the following secret communication from Amy to Bob:
I will meet you under the Maple tree in the Sleepy Hollow Park between 11:00 PM
and 11:15 PM tonight.
To authenticate the message, the receiver Bob needs to be absolutely sure that it was Amy
who sent the message. If the key is indeed secret between Amy and Bob, then confidentiality
leads to authentication, as no third party can generate or forge such a message.
However, this is not all. Consider what will happen if following an unfortunate
sequence of events, Amy and Bob end up in a court of law, where Amy denies having ever
sent such a message? Can we prove that Amy is telling a lie? This requires a mechanism
by which messages can be signed, so that a third party can verify the signature. Problems
like these are quite likely with contracts in the business world or with transactions over
the Internet.
The primary goal of digital signatures is to find a way to bind the identity of the signatory
with the message of the text. We discuss how a message can be signed in both secret
and public cryptosystems.
19.7.1 Signatures in Secret-Key Cryptosystems
To generate a signed message, both Amy and Bob should have a trusted third party, Charlie.
For the sake of nonrepudiation, Amy will append to her original message M an encrypted
form of a message digest m (known as a message authentication code, or MAC). The message
digest m is a fixed-length entity that is computed from M using a hash function H, which is
expected to generate a unique footprint of M. (The uniqueness holds with very high probability
against accidental or malicious modifications only.) In case of a dispute, anyone can
ask the trusted third party, Charlie, to compute m′ = H(M) and compare the result with
the signature m. The signature is verified only if m = m′. If the channel is not secret and
confidentiality is also an issue, then Amy has to further encrypt (M, m) using her secret
key k. The major weakness here is the need for a trusted third party who will know the
secret key of Amy and Bob.
19.7.2 Signatures in Public-Key Cryptosystems
To sign a document in public-key cryptosystem, Amy will compute a digest m = H(M) of
her message M using a hash function H, encrypt the digest m with her private key dA, and
send out (M, dA(m)). Now Bob (in fact, anyone) can decrypt dA(m) using the public key eA
of Amy and compare it with m′ = H(M). When m = m′, it is implied that only Amy could
have sent the message M, since no one else would know Amy’s secret key. Digital signatures
using public-key cryptosystems is much more popular and practical, since it does not
require the sharing or distribution of the private key.
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 419
19.8 HASHING ALGORITHMS
Hash functions are used to reduce a variable length message to a fixed-length fingerprint.
Also known as cryptographic hash function, such a function H should have the following
properties:
1. Computing m = H(M) from a given M should be easy, but computing the inverse
function that will uniquely identify M from a given m should be impossible.
2. M ≠ M′ ⇒ H(M) ≠ H(M′). Thus, any modification of the original message M will
cause its footprint to change.
The second condition is difficult to fulfill for any hash function, so ordinarily, the interpretation
of M′ is restricted to malicious modifications of M. The number of (M,M′) pairs
that lead to the same fingerprint is a measure of the robustness of the hash function.
A well-known hash function is SHA-2 that was adopted by NIST after weaknesses were
discovered in the two earlier hash functions MD5 and SHA-1. SHA-2 is a family of that
includes two hash functions SHA-256 and SHA-512 with different block sizes. Many of
the US government agencies now use SHA-2 for various security-related applications.
SHA-2 hash function is also implemented in some widely used security applications and
protocols like SSL/TLS, PGP, and SSH. In 2012, NIST selected a new hash function SHA-3
that uses a new algorithm and not derived from SHA-2. As of now, the decision about
adopting SHA-3 is pending.
19.8.1 Birthday Attack
The birthday attack is a cryptographic attack (on hashing algorithms) that exploits the
mathematics behind the birthday paradox: if a function y = f(x) yields any of n different
output values of y with equal probability and n is sufficiently large, then after evaluating the
function f for about n different arguments, we expect to find a pair of arguments x1 and
x2 such that f(x1) = f(x2) with a probability p > 0.5—this is known as a collision.
Now, apply this to the birthdays of a set of people who assembled in a room. There are
365 possible different birthdays (month and day). So if there are more than 365 people in
the room, then we will expect at least two persons having the same birthday. In fact, it can
be shown that with more than 23 people, the probability that two of them have the same
birthday is > 0.5. If the outputs of the function are distributed unevenly, then a collision
can occur even faster.
Digital signatures in secret-key cryptosystems are susceptible to birthday attack. A message
M is signed by first computing m = H(M), where H is a cryptographic hash function,
and then encrypting m with their secret key k. Suppose Bob wants to trick Alice into signing
a fraudulent contract. Bob prepares two contracts: a fair contract M and a fraudulent
one M′. He then finds a number of positions where M can be changed without changing the
meaning, such as inserting commas, empty lines, and spaces. By combining these changes,
he can create a huge number of variations on M that are all fair contracts. In a similar
420 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
manner, he also creates a huge number of variations on the fraudulent contract M′. He then
applies the hash function to all these variations until he finds a version of the fair contract
and a version of the fraudulent contract having the same hash value. He presents the fair
version to Alice for signing. After Alice has signed, Bob takes the signature and attaches it
to the fraudulent contract. This signature apparently proves that Alice signed the fraudulent
contract. For a good hash function, it should be extremely difficult to find a pair of
messages M and M′ with the same digest.
19.9 ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY
Contrary to some beliefs, an elliptic curve is not the same as an ellipse.
An elliptic curve is defined by equation y2 = x3 + ax + b. There are more general versions
of elliptic curves, but for our purpose, this will suffice. The coefficients of the equation must
satisfy the condition 4a3 + 27b2 ≠ 0, which is a necessary and sufficient condition that the
polynomial has three distinct roots, a condition required by the cryptosystem. The elliptic
curve of Figure 19.4 is generated from the equation y2 = x3 − 6x + 6.
Let q, r be a pair of points on an elliptic curve. The curve is symmetric around a horizontal
axis (in this case the x-axis). For any point p, designate its mirror image (reflection
around the x-axis) by the notation −p. The addition operation (+) is defined as follows:
1. When q ≠ −r, q + r is computed by drawing a straight line through q and r. Let this
line intersect the elliptic curve at point −p. Take the reflection of −p around the x-axis
(which is p). Then q + r = p.
2. When q = −r, the line joining them is vertical and parallel to the y-axis. This does
not intersect the elliptic curve at a third point. This is addressed by including a special
third point ∞ on the curve. Call it the identity element I. Then q + (−q) = I. This
implies q + I = q.
3. When q = r, the sum q + q (also called 2q) is defined by drawing a tangent to the
curve at point q. Let it intersect the elliptic curve at point −r. Then q + q = 2q = r (the
reflection
of the point −r around the x-axis).

The last step defines the multiplication (by two) operation that can be generalized to
multiplication
by any nonnegative scalar integer by treating this as repeated addition.
Thus, 3q = 2q + q = r + q = p. For a point like t where the tangent is parallel to the y-axis,

and so on.
In cryptography, the variables and the constants are not real numbers—instead, they are
always chosen from a finite field—as a result x, y, a, b have integer values assigned from a
finite set of integers. The various values of (x, y) on the elliptic curve along with the addition
operation and the identity element form an Abelian group. All computations are done
modulo p, where p is a prime number.
Prior to a secret communication, both Amy and Bob must agree upon using a specific elliptic
curve (which is not a secret) and a specific point F on that curve. Amy then picks a secret
random number dA that is her secret key, computes eA = dA ⋅ F, and publishes it as her public
key. In the same manner, Bob will also pick his secret key dB and publish a public key eB = dB ⋅ F.
To send the secret message M, Amy will simply compute dA ⋅ eB and use the result as the
secret key to encrypt M using a conventional symmetric block cipher (like 3DES or AES).
To decrypt this ciphertext, Bob has to know the secret key of the block cipher. Bob will be
able to compute this by calculating dB ⋅ eA, since

The security of the previous scheme is based on the property of elliptic curves that given
F and k · F, it is intractable to compute k when the keys are large (computationally, this is
equivalent to the discrete logarithm problem discussed earlier). In the case of communication
between Amy and Bob, eA = dA ⋅ F, both eA and F are known, but it is extremely difficult
to compute the secret key dA. The same applies to the computation of dB, Bob’s secret key.
19.10 AUTHENTICATION SERVER
An AS (also called a key distribution center) is a trusted central agent whose responsibility
is to distribute conversation keys among clients, prior to initiating an authenticated conversation.
It is a tricky job that has to be done right to preserve the integrity of the keys. The
schemes described here are due to Needham and Schroeder [NS78].
422 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
19.10.1 Authentication Service for Secret-Key Cryptosystems
Let four users A, B, C, D be connected to an AS S. For each user i, the server maintains a
unique key ki (like a password) that is only known to user i and the server S. This is different
from the secret key kij to be used in the conversation between users i and j. We will use
the notation ki(M) to represent a message M encrypted by the key ki. Obviously, i is the only
user who can decrypt it. Here is a summary of the protocol that user A will use to obtain a
conversation key kAB between A and B:
A → S Give me a conversation key to communicate with B
S → A Retrieve kAB from the message kA(B, kAB, kB(kAB, A))
A → B Retrieve kAB from kB(kAB, A) that I obtained from S
B → A Yes, can you decode kAB(nB) and decrement the argument?
A → B Here is kAB(nB−1)
In the previous exchange, nB (called a nonce) is meant for single use. When B finds A’s
answer to be correct, a secure communication channel is established between A and B.
To sign a document, A will first convert the original plaintext M into a digest m of a
smaller size and then use the following protocol:
A → S Give me a signature block for the message m.
S → A Here is kS(m)—please append it to your message.
Now, A sends kAB(M,kS(m)) to B. To verify the signature, B computes the digest m′ from
the message decrypted by it and sends it to S for signature verification. In response, S now
sends back kS(m′) to B. If kS(m) = kS(m′), then B verifies the signature of A and hence the
authenticity of the message from A.
Safeguard from replay attacks: This problem is related to the freshness of the message that
is being transmitted. It is possible for an intruder to copy and replay the ciphertext, and the
recipient has no way of knowing if this is a replay of an old valid message. Imagine what
will happen if an intruder unknowingly replays your encrypted message to your banker:
“Transfer $100 from my account to Mr. X’s account.” One way to get around this problem is to
include a special identifier with each communication session. Ideally, such an identifier will
be used only once and never be repeated—this is a safeguard against possible replay attack.
For example, A, while asking for a conversation key from S, will include such an identifier nA
with the request, and S will include that in the body of its reply to A. Such an integer is called
a nonce. Typically, it is a counter or a time stamp. Prior to each message transmission, the two
parties have to agree to a nonce. The reuse of the same nonce signals a replay attack.
19.10.2 Authentication Server for Public-Key Systems
It is assumed that everyone knows the public key eS of the server S. To communicate with
B, A will first obtain the public key of B from the AS.
A → S Give me the public key eB of B
S → A Here is dS(eB)
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 423
Now, A can decrypt it using the public key of the server S. This prevents A from receiving a
bogus key eB from an imposter. B can obtain the public key from A in the same way. In the
next step, A and B perform a handshake:
A → B eB(nA) Only B can understand it
B → A eA(nB, nA) Only A can understand it.
A finds that B successfully received its nonce
A → B eB(nB) B finds that A successfully decrypted its nonce
Now A and B are ready to communicate with each other.
19.11 DIGITAL CERTIFICATES
A certificate is a document issued to a user by a trusted party. The certificate identifies
the user and is like a passport or a driver’s license. When Amy wants to withdraw $5000
from her account in Sunrise Bank, Iowa, Sunrise Bank needs to be absolutely sure that it
is Amy who is trying to access her account. So Amy will produce a certificate issued by
Sunrise Bank and signed by the bank’s private key. The components of a certificate are
as follows:
Name Amy Weber
Issued by Sunrise Bank, Iowa
Certificate type Checking account number
Account number 1234567
Public key 1A2B3C4D5E6F
Signature of the issuer Signed using the private key of Sunrise Bank
In electronic banking, the web browser uses digital certificates to enhance the security
of access. They are electronic counterparts to ATM cards and must be presented by the
browser to the bank before the bank will permit the user access to her account. The bank
ATM card stores an encrypted version of a digital certificate along with other information
that may be needed by a financial institution. Used in conjunction with encryption, user id,
and password, digital certificates provide an acceptable security solution.
In a slightly different scenario, when Amy wants to electronically transfer $5000 to a car
dealership for buying her car, she presents the certificate to the dealership. The dealership
will want to verify the signature of the bank using their public key. Once the signature is
verified, the dealership trusts Amy’s public key in the certificate and accepts it for future
transactions.
A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a mechanism for the certification of user identities by
a third party. It binds public keys of each user to her identity. For verifying the authenticity
of the public key of Sunrise Bank, the car dealership may check Sunrise Bank’s certificate
issued by a higher authority. The chain soon closes in on important certification authorities.
These certification authorities sign their own certificates, which are distributed in a
trusted manner. An example of a certification authority is Verisign (www.verisign.com),
where individuals and businesses can acquire their public-key certificates by submitting
424 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
acceptable proofs of their identity. Public keys of important certification authorities are
also posted on the WWW. The correctness of these keys is the basis of the trust.
A widely used certification format is X.509, which is one component of the CCITT’s*
standard for constructing global directories of names. It binds a public key to a distinguished
name, or an email address, or a DNS entry. In addition to the public key certificate,
it also specifies a certification path validation algorithm. Note that the names
used in a certificate may not be unique. To establish the credentials of the owner and her
certificate (or the certificate issuer’s signature), references to other individuals or organizations
may be necessary. In PKI, the administrative issues of who trusts whom can get
quite complex.
19.12 CASE STUDIES
In this section, we present three security protocols for the real world. The first one uses
secret-key encryption, and the two others are hybrid, since they use both public-key and
secret-key encryption.
19.12.1 Kerberos
Kerberos is an authentication service developed at MIT as a part of Project Athena. It uses
secret keys and is based on the Needham–Schroeder authentication protocol. The functional
components of Kerberos are shown in Figure 19.5. Clients and servers are required
to have their keys registered with an AS. Servers include the file server, mail server, secure
login, and print server. The users’ keys are derived from their passwords, and the servers’
keys are randomly chosen. For enhanced security, an unencrypted password should neither
travel over the network nor be stored on the client machine or even the AS database.
Once a password is used, it must be immediately discarded. Client A planning to communicate
with a server first contacts the AS and acquires a session key kA,TGS. This allows

communications standards.

Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 425
A to communicate with a ticket-granting service (TGS). A ticket is an entity that a client
presents to an application server to demonstrate the authenticity of its identity. When the
session key kA,TGS is presented to the TGS, it issues a session key that enables the client to
communicate with a specific server for a predefined window of time.
A sample authentication and ticket-granting operation is outlined here:
A → AS Give me a key to communicate with TGS
AS → A Retrieve kA,TGS from kA,AS(kA,TGS,kAS,TGS(kA,TGS,A))
(Here kA,TGS is A’s key for TGS, and kAS,TGS(kA,TGS,A) is the ticket)
A → TGS Here is my ticket kAS,TGS(kA,TGS,A) issued by AS.
Now grant me a session key to contact server B.
TGS → A TGS retrieves kA,TGS and sends kA,TGS((kA,B,B,T),kB,TGS(kA,B,A,T))
(A will retrieve the session key kA,B from it. T is the expiration time).
A → B kB,TGS(kA,B,A,T) (B will retrieve kA,B from this)
If a client asked only the AS to generate kA,B, then the reply would have been encrypted
with kA,AS, and A would have to use kA,AS to decrypt it. This means entering the password
for each session (it is a bad idea to cache passwords). In the two-step process, to obtain a
session key for any other service, it is sufficient to show the ticket to TGS. The expiration
time (usually 10 h) prevents the reuse of a stolen ticket at a later moment. The two-step
process thus relieves the user from repeatedly entering the password, and this improves
the security.
Although AS and TGS are functionally different, they can physically reside in the
same machine. For small-scale systems, a single AS–TGS is adequate. However, as the
scale of the system grows, the AS–TGS unit becomes a bottleneck. So Kerberos designers
divide the network into realms across organizational boundaries. Each realm has its own
AS and TGS.
After a successful login, clients use tickets to acquire separate session key for file servers,
printers, remote login, or email. Initially, Kerberos 4 used DES for encryption, but it has
been retired in Kerberos 5, which allows a range of more secure encryption methods—
these include 3DES, AES-128, and AES-256.
19.12.2 Pretty Good Privacy
On April 17, 1991, New York Times reported on an unsettling US Senate proposal. It is
part of a counterterrorism bill that would force manufacturers of secure communication
equipments to insert special trap doors in their products, so that the government could
read anyone’s encrypted messages. The US government’s concern was to prevent encrypted
communications related to clandestine operation with entities outside the United States.
The US government was quite concerned about the rising circulation of RSA public-key
encryption at that time. This led Philip Zimmermann to develop PGP cryptosystem in
a hurry before the bill was put to vote. Zimmermann distributed PGP as a freeware. In a
way, this bill led to the birth of PGP encryption, although the US government’s bill was
later defeated.
426 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
PGP is primarily used to encrypt emails. It is a hybrid cryptosystem that combines the
best features of both private and public-key cryptography. To encrypt a message, PGP
takes the following steps:
1. It compresses the plaintext M. In addition to saving disk space and transmission
time, data compression increases its resilience to cryptanalysis that relies on discovering
patterns in the plaintext.
2. It generates a session key derived from the random movements of the sender’s mouse
and the sender’s keystrokes. The session key is a one-time secret key.
3. It encrypts (a) the compressed data with the session key and (b) also encrypts the session
key with the public key of the recipient. The two are then transmitted.
To decrypt the message, the recipient first retrieves the session key using her private key
and then uses this key to decrypt (and subsequently decompress) the ciphertext.
While the use of public-key cryptography overcomes the key distribution problem, the
encryption of the plaintext using secret keys is much faster than public-key encryption.
PGP keys are 512–1024 bits long. Longer keys are cryptographically more secure. PGP
stores the keys on the user’s hard disk in files called keyrings. The public keyring holds the
public keys of parties that the sender wants to communicate with, and the private keyring
stores the sender’s private keys.
19.12.3 Secure Socket Layer
The SSL protocol was developed by Netscape to establish secure communication between
applications on the Internet. SSL 3.0 (available from 1996) received endorsements from
the credit card giants Visa and MasterCard. SSL certifies the identity of the website to an
online user and allows clients to communicate with servers while preserving confidentiality
and integrity. The upper layer protocol is HTTP (for web service), or IMAP (for mail
service), or FTP (for file transfer), and the lower layer protocol is TCP. These higher-level
services process their requests through SSL. The upper layer protocol has two layers: a
handshake layer and a record layer.
The handshake layer is the upper layer that provides three guarantees:
1. At least one of the peers is authenticated using public-key cryptography.
2. The shared secret key negotiated between the peers remains unavailable to
eavesdroppers.
3. No intruder can transparently modify the communication.
The initial handshake uses public-key cryptography and helps establish a shared
secret key, which is subsequently used for secure communication. The following steps
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 427
illustrate the establishment of a secure shared key, when a client (Amy) communicates
with a web server (Bob):
Amy: Sends a ClientHello: at this time, she presents Bob with (1) a session id, (2) protocol
version (http here), (3) a list of block or stream ciphers (in order of preference) that is
supported by her machine, (4) a set of message compression algorithms (like MD5,
SHA-2) that is supported by her machine, and (5) a random data to be used for secret
key generation.
Bob: Responds with a ServerHello: now Bob (1) picks a cipher of his choice and the message
compression algorithm to be used, (2) echoes the session id, and (3) sends random
data to be used for secret-key generation. Then Bob presents his certificate and
(optionally) asks Amy for her certificate.
Amy: Verifies Bob’s certificate and presents her own certificate. Then she creates a premaster
secret and sends it to Bob using his public key obtained from his certificate.
Bob: Verifies Amy’s certificate and decrypts the premaster secret using his private key.
Both Amy and Bob now move to the Client Key Exchange phase, where they use the
premaster
secret and the random numbers to create a new master secret. Both will use the
master secret to generate the session keys—these are symmetric keys that will be used to
encrypt and decrypt information exchanged during the SSL session. When all these are
done, Amy and Bob exchange a Change Cipher Spec message followed by a finished message.
This signals
that they will use these keys for the rest of the session. The secure session can
now begin.
The record layer is the lower layer that fragments the messages into manageable blocks,
compresses the data, appends a message digest using the hash function from the agreed
protocol suite, and encrypts, before transmitting it through the TCP connection. Received
data are decrypted, decompressed, reassembled, and then delivered to the client.
SSL 3.0 has been later upgraded to TLS 1.0 [DA99], so the protocol is referred to as
SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0. Despite many similarities, they are not interoperable. There is a potential
for a man-in-the-middle attack in SSL, and TSL 1.0 initially claimed to address it. However,
in 2009, the vulnerability of SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 against a man-in-the-middle attack was made
public. Despite its feasibility in laboratory scale experiments, there is no documented history
of such industrial strength attacks. An absolute safeguard is to send the public key of
the server to the client via a separate channel. The client can take advantage of browsers and
some Internet software that are distributed via CD-ROMs for obtaining the public keys.
The various ciphers and the message digest functions are preloaded at each site. When
a user communicates with a secure site on the WWW, she notices https:// instead of http://
in the URL. The word https means http using SSL.
The implementation of SSL uses hybrid encryption, where the mutual authentication
is based on public keys, but final communication uses the secret keys. This is because
428 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
public-key-based encryption and decryption mechanisms are computationally expensive—
so their use should be minimized as much as possible. Due to its extreme popularity in
e-commerce, SSL/TLS is supported by almost all browsers.
19.13 VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS AND FIREWALLS
Unlike cryptographic solutions to security that are primarily implemented above the TCP/
IP layers, virtual private networks (VPNs) and firewalls provide security by tweaking some
of the lower layers of the protocol stack.
19.13.1 Virtual Private Network
A VPN is a trusted communication tunnel between two or more devices across an
untrusted public network (like the Internet). Businesses today are faced with supporting a
broad variety of communications among a wider range of sites and escalating communication
cost. Employees are looking to access the resources of their corporate intranets as
they take to the road, telecommute, or dial in from customer sites. In addition, business
partners share business information, either for a joint project of a few months’ duration
or for long-term strategic advantage. Wide-area networking between the main corporate
network and branch offices, using dedicated leased lines or frame-relay circuits, does not
provide the flexibility required for quickly creating new partner links or supporting project
teams in the field. The rapid growth of the number of telecommuters and an increasingly
mobile sales force gobbles up resources as more money is spent on modem banks and longdistance
phone charges. VPN provides a solution to this problem without using leased
lines or WAN.
VPNs rely on tunneling to create a private network that reaches across the Internet.
Tunneling is the process of encapsulating an entire packet within another packet and sending
it over a network. The network understands the protocol of the outer packet and knows
its endpoints (i.e., where the packet enters and exits the network). There are two types of
endpoints for tunnels: an individual computer or a LAN with a security gateway, which
might be a router (or a firewall). The tunnel uses cryptographically protected secure channels
at the IP or link level (using protocols like IPSec or L2TP) and relieves the application
layer from overseeing the security requirements. Tunneling has interesting implications
for VPNs. For example, one can place a packet that uses a protocol not supported on the
Internet inside an IP packet and send it safely over the Internet. Or one can put a packet
that uses a private IP address inside a packet that uses a globally unique IP address to
extend a private network over the Internet.
An obvious question is: Do we need VPN if we use SSL? What is the difference between
the two? Protocols used to implement VPN operate at a much lower level (network or link
layer) in the network protocol stack. The advantage of having the crypto bits at a lower level
is that they work for all applications/protocols. On the flip side, to support this capability,
extra software is needed. SSL caters to client–server communication, and the extra software
is already packaged into all web browsers.
Security in Distributed Systems ◾ 429
19.13.2 Firewall
A firewall is a filter between your private network (a zone of high trust) and the Internet
(a zone of low trust). A personal firewall provides controlled connectivity between a personal
computer and the Internet, whereas a network firewall regulates the traffic between
a local network and the Internet. Firewalls can be configured according to an individual
or an organization’s security requirements. They can restrict the number of open ports or
determine what types of packets will pass through and which protocols will be allowed.
Application layer firewalls can inspect the contents of the traffic and block inappropriate
materials or known viruses. Some VPN products are upgraded to include firewall
capabilities.
19.14 SHARING A SECRET
Consider the following problem: Nine members of a family have their family treasures
guarded in a safe that can be opened by a secret code. No individual should know this
secret code. The locking mechanism should be such that the lock can be opened if and
only if five or more of the members cooperate with one another. To protect data, one can
encrypt it, but to protect a secret key, further encryptions will not help. One also needs
to safeguard against a single point of failure that could destroy the key. Making multiple
copies of the key appears to be a solution to the problem of single point of failure, but it
increases the danger of a security breach—by not taking the majority into confidence, anyone
can open the safe himself or herself or with the help of a small number of accomplices.
What we are looking for is a mechanism of splitting a secret code. How to split a secret
code and hand over the pieces to the members of the family, so that this becomes possible?
In [S79], Shamir proposed a solution to the problem of sharing a secret key.
Shamir’s solution is as follows: let D be the secret code that we want to safeguard, n be
the number of members, and k be the quorum, that is, the smallest number of members
who must cooperate with one another to open the safe. Without loss of generality, consider
D to be an integer. Shamir used polynomial interpolation: Given k distinct points
(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xk,yk) on the 2D plane, there is one and only one polynomial q(x) of degree
k − 1, such that ∀i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k : yi = q(xi). Now pick any polynomial q(x) of degree (k − 1):
q x a a x a x ak x
k ( ) = +  +  + + −

The only requirement here is that a0 = D, the secret code. Now, pick a set of values 1, 2, 3, …, n
for x and use the above polynomial to evaluate D1 = q(1), D2 = q(2), D3 = q(3),…,Dn = q(n). From
any subset of k of these (i, Di) values, one can find all the coefficients of q(x) by interpolation.
This includes finding the value of a0 = D, the secret code. However, by using fewer than k of
these values of Di, no one can derive D. So these n values D1,D2,D3,…,Dn can be distributed as
pieces of the secret code, so that any k out of n holders of the pieces have to come together to
decrypt the secret. Such a scheme is known as a (k, n)-threshold scheme for secret sharing. To
avoid two disjoint quorums, it makes sense to make [(n + 1)/2] ≤ k ≤ n.
430 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The keys can be made more uniform in size by using mod p arithmetic, where p is a
prime number larger than D and n. All keys will be in the range [0, p). The mechanism is
robust: A loss of a single key or member poses no threat to the security. A new member can
be added to the family by generating another key piece.
19.15 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Security is a never-ending game. The moment we think we have provided enough security
to data or communication, crooks, hackers, and cryptanalysts start digging out loopholes.
New algorithms are developed for operations whose apparent intractability provided the
cornerstone of security. In addition, technological progress enables the development of
faster machines with enormous computing power, which simplifies code breaking. Yet,
electronic transactions in the business world have increased so much that we need some
security—we cannot sleep with our doors open. Every web server installed at a site opens
a window to the Internet. History shows that complex software usually has bugs—it needs
a smart crook to discover some of them and use these as security loopholes. This reaffirms
the importance of designing reliable software.
Digital certificates were proposed to authenticate transactions between parties unknown
to each other. PKI was formulated to assist a client in making decisions about whether to
proceed with an electronic transaction. Traditional PKI has come under criticism. The fact
that online transactions are increasing rapidly without much help of PKI is paradoxical.
Some find the traditional proof of identity to be intrusive. The one-size-fits-all electronic
passport has been a topic of debate.
Since the past decade, phishing has been a major source of security fraud. According to
the RSA Fraud report published by EMC, the total number of phishing attacks launched in
2012 was 59% higher than that in 2011, leading to an estimated global loss of $1.5 billion
in 2012. The fraudulent websites typically last for a week or less.

EXERCISES
19.1 Learning how to attack is an important component of learning about security methods.
A well-known technique for breaking common substitution ciphers is frequency
analysis. It is based on the fact that in a stretch of the English language, certain letters
and combinations occur with varying frequencies: For example, the letter E is
quite common, while the letter X is very infrequent. Similarly, the combinations NG
or TH are quite common, but the combinations TJ or SQ are very rare. The array
of letters in decreasing order of frequency are E T A O I N S H R D L U … J, Q,
X, Z. Basic frequency analysis counts the frequency of each letter and each phrase
in the ciphertext and tries to deduce the plaintext from the known frequency of
occurrences.
Search the web to find data about frequency analysis [L00]. Then use frequency
analysis to decrypt the following cipher:
WKH HDVLHVW PHWKRG RI HQFLSKHULQJ D WHAW PHVVDJH
LV WR UHSODFH HDFK FKDUDFWHU EB DQRWKHU XVLQJ D
ILAHG UXOH, VR IRU HADPSOH HYHUB OHWWHU D PDB
EH UHSODFHG EB G, DQG HYHUB OHWWHU E EB WKH OHWWHU
H DQG VR RQ.
(Hint: Do a frequency analysis of the single letter in the ciphertext. Then try to
match it with the frequency analysis data and discover the mapping.)
19.2 A simple form of substitution cipher is the affine cipher that generates the ciphertext
for an English language plaintext as follows: (1) The plaintext is represented using a
string of integers in the range [0..25] (a = 0, b = 1, c = 2 … and so on), and (2) for each
plaintext letter P, the corresponding ciphertext letter C = a ⋅ P + b mod 26, where
0 < a, b < 26 and a and b are relatively prime to 26.
Bob generated the ciphertext C by encrypting the plaintext P twice using two
different secret keys k1 and k2. Thus, C = Ek1(Ek2(P)). Show that if affine ciphers are
used for encryption, then the resulting encryption is possible using just a single
affine cipher.
19.3 Your bank asked you to change your netbanking password. The previous password
had six characters consisting of lowercase letters and integers. The new password
will have at least eight characters—it must contain both upper and lower case letters,
integers, and a special character chosen from @,*,−,^,&. If you choose a new
password whose length is 10 characters, then how much more effort (measured by
the number of steps) will be needed to break your password compared with the previous
scenario?

19.4 What are the advantages and disadvantages of CBC over simple block ciphers?
19.5 Certain types of message digests are considered good for cryptographic checksums.
Is the sum of all bits a good cryptographic checksum? Why or why not? Suggest a
measure of this goodness.
19.6 Let W′ denote the bit pattern obtained by flipping every bit of a binary integer W.
Then show that the following result holds for DES encryption
C Ek P C Ek P = ( )  = ( )
19.7 To authenticate a message m using ElGamal cryptosystem, Alice picks a hash
function H and computes a message digest H(m). Then she (1) chooses a prime p
and a random number k(0 < k < p) relatively prime to (p − 1), (2) finds numbers
r and s such that r = hk (mod p) and H(m) = x ⋅ r + k ⋅ s mod (p−1) (such a pair (r, s)
is guaranteed to exist when k is relatively prime to (p − 1)), and (3) sends the signature
as (r, s). Bob verifies the signature as authentic, only if 0 < r, s < p−1 and
gH(m) = hr ⋅ rs. Prove that the previous condition authenticates the message from
Alice [see E84].
19.8 Consider the following protocol for communication from Alice to Bob:
a. Alice signs a secret message M with her private key, then encrypts it with Bob’s
public key, and sends the result to Bob, that is, A → B : eB(dA(M)).
b. Bob decrypts the message using his private key dB and then verifies the signature
using Alice’s public key eA, that is, eA(dB(eB(dA(M)))) = M.
c. Bob signs the message with his private key, encrypts it with Alice’s public key,
and sends the result back to Alice, B → A : eA(dB(M)).
d. Alice decrypts the message with her private key and verifies the signature using
Bob’s public key. If the result is the same as the one she sent Bob, she knows that
Bob correctly received the secret message M.
Part 1: Show that this protocol violates confidentiality. Let Mallory be an active
hacker who intercepts the encrypted signed message eB(dA(M)) communicated
by Alice to Bob in step 1. Show that Mallory can use a modified protocol (by
changing only steps (a) and (d)) to learn the original secret M without Bob (or
Alice) noticing.
Part 2: Consider ways of repairing the protocol. Will the use of different sets of keys
for signing/verification and encryption/decryption fix the problem?
19.9 The security of RSA encryption is based on the apparent difficulty of computing the
prime factors s, t of a large integer N = s × t. Investigate what are some of the fast
algorithms for computing the factors of N.

payroll department. Access to payroll data requires a special password. Devise a
scheme so that payroll data cannot be accessed unless any three out of five employees
reach an agreement about carrying out the task. Implement your scheme, and provide
a demonstration.
19.12 A birthday attack refers to the observation that in a room containing only 23
people or more, there is a better than even chance that 2 of the people in the room
have the same birthday even though the chances of a person having any specific
birthday is 1 in 365. The point is, although it might be very difficult to find M
from m = H(m), it is considerably easier to find two different messages (M,M′)
with identical hash.
Using this fact, explain how birthday attacks can be used to get the signature of
someone on a fraudulent document.
19.13 Experts are concerned about various kinds of loopholes in Internet voting. Study
how Internet voting is carried out in practice, and think of how Internet voting can
be misused.
Programming Exercises
19.1 Dr. Susan L. Gerhart and her team, with funding from NSF, designed a simple version
of DES (called S-DES). It is a block cipher that uses 8-bit blocks and a 10-bit key.
See http://security.rbaumann.net/modtech.php?sel=2 for a description.
Design an encryption and decryption system working on printable ASCII text
using S-DES. Consider only the letters from A to Z, a to z, the digits 0 to 9, and the
two punctuation symbols: space (writing it as underscore) and period (this accounts
for 64 symbols). Give a few examples of how to use your system.
19.2 PGP is a popular cryptosystem that helps the exchange of confidential email messages.
Download and install PGP from its official website* to your personal computer.
Run PGPkeys (e.g., click on the PGPtray icon on your taskbar and choose
Launch PGPkeys), and use the on-screen instructions to generate your initial private
key. To choose the key size, select the default option. Upload your public key to
the keyserver using the on-screen instructions.
PGP stores your private key in a file called secring.skr. PGPfreeware guards your
private key by asking you to invent a secret hint that only you will know.
Obtain public keys: To send encrypted email to someone, you need to get that person’s
public key. Obtain the public key of the TA or a friend, and add this key to your
public key ring. There are several ways to do this:
1. Look to see if the person has their public key on their web page. Copy that
key in full to the clipboard, click on the PGP icon, and select “Add Key from
Clipboard.”
* PGP freeware version 8.0 can be downloaded, for both PC and Mac, from http://www.pgpi.org/.
434 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
2. Look into the central keyserver where most people put their public keys (you did
this in step 1). To do this, run PGPkeys, select Keys/Search, type (any part of)
the person’s name or email address in the User id box, and click Search. If the
key is found, then right-click on it and select “Import to Local Key ring.”
3. Ask the person to send you their public key by email, and use the same method
as in the prior step.
Encrypt your message: To send an encrypted message, choose a text file, right-click
on it, and choose the PGP menu item that offers to encrypt it. Select (drag and drop)
the name of the user for whom you want to encrypt; this will encrypt your message
using the public key of the user. The result is a new file with the same name, but with
an added .pgp extension.
Send email: To send the encrypted message, attach the .pgp file to your email. Check
with the recipient to verify if she could decrypt it.
19.3 Team up with two other persons, and let these two run a communication across a
communication channel that has not been secured. We suggest that you run the
experiment on a dedicated network in a lab that is not being used by others. Now
implement a man-in-the middle attack, and then divulge to the team members how
you launched the attack.
19.4 Implement an application layer firewall that will block all emails containing a given
topic of your choice.

Sensor Networks
20.1 VISION
In the 21st century, the number of processors in daily use vastly outnumbers the laptops
or desktop computers or personal digital assistants. Most gadgets that have become indispensable
for us contain one or more processors. A state-of-the-art automobile has 50 or
more processors in it. These sense various conditions and actuate devices for our safety
or comfort. With the advancement of technology, the physical size of the processors has
diminished, and a new breed of applications has emerged that relies on miniature postagestamp-
size processors sensing physical parameters and performing wireless communication
with one another to achieve a collective goal. The primary job of a sensor network
is tracking and monitoring. Estrin et al. [EGH+99] summarized the endless potential of
sensor networks that range from ecological monitoring to industrial automation, smart
homes, military arena, disaster management, security devices, sustainability, and healthrelated
application. Some of these applications have been developed during the past few
years, and new areas of applications are constantly being explored. In addition, with the
rapid penetration of smartphones that are equipped with a few sensors, new applications
are emerging almost on a daily basis. These are slowly but surely transforming our daily
lives and habits and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
The technology of networked sensors dates back to the days of the Cold War. The SOund
SUrveillance System (SOSUS) was a system of acoustic sensors deployed at the bottom
of the ocean to sense and track Soviet submarines. Modern research on sensor networks
started since the 1980s under the leadership of Defense Research Advanced Projects
Agency (DARPA) of the US government. However, the technology was not quite ready
until the late 1990s.
Imagine hundreds of sensor nodes being airdropped on a minefield. These sensor nodes
form an ad hoc wireless network, map out the location of the buried mines, and return
the location information to a low-flying aircraft. Nodes may be damaged or swept away in
wind and rain. In fact, the loss or failure of such devices is an expected event—yet the sheer
number of these devices is often enough to overcome the impact of failures. As another
436 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
example in disaster management, randomly deployed sensor nodes in a disaster zone
can help identify hot spots and guide rescuers toward it as quickly as possible. A flagship
problem
is to rescue people from one of the upper floors of a tall building where a fire
breaks out, and two of the four stairwells are unusable due to carbon monoxide formation.
These outline the kind of applications charted for sensor networks.
Some deployments of sensor networks are preplanned, as in automobiles or safety
devices. Others are ad hoc in nature. Sensor networks can be wired or wireless. In this
chapter, we will primarily focus on wireless sensor networks.
20.2 ARCHITECTURE OF SENSOR NODES
A wireless sensor network is a wireless network of miniature sensor nodes. These nodes
sense various types of environmental parameters, execute simple instructions, and communicate
with neighboring nodes within their radio range. The growth of sensor networks
is largely due to the availability of miniature inexpensive sensors based on micro electro
mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. With several vendors jumping in, users now have
a choice of sensor nodes that can be used as the building blocks of sensor networks. In addition,
many smartphones are equipped with camera, microphone, GPS, compass, and accelerometers,
which have led to the development of various opportunistic and participatory
sensing technologies.
20.2.1 MICA Mote
The UC Berkeley researchers and their collaborators pioneered the design of a class of
sensor
nodes called MICA® motes.* Several versions of these sensor nodes (MICA2,
MICAZ) are now available for prototype design. A typical third-generation MICA mote
consists of an 8-bit ATMEL ATMEGA 128L processor running at 4 MHz, with 128 kB of
flash memory
for program storage and a 4 kB SRAM for read–write memory. It also has
a 512 kB flash memory for storing serial data from measurements. The data are received
via 10-bit analog-to-digital converters from sensor cards attached to it. The serial port
is used for downloading programs from (or uploading results to) a desktop or a laptop
PC. A multichannel
radio that can work at 868/916 or 433 or 315 MHz serves as the realworld
communication conduit. It can send or receive data at 40 kbps. The radio range is
programmable
up to 500 ft, but the actual coverage depends on environmental conditions.
Control signals configure
the radio to either transmit or receive or the power-off mode.
A schematic diagram
of a MICA mote is shown in Figure 20.1.
Each mote is battery powered. Since the motes need to perform in unattended conditions
for a long time, energy conservation is a major issue, even if the battery technology
has been improving. The radio consumes less than 1 μΑ when it is off, 10 mA when it is
receiving data, and 25 mA when transmitting—so conserving radio power by minimizing
communication is a key to longer battery life. The processor consumes only 8 mA when it
* MICA mote is a product of Crossbow Technology. The data refer to MPR400CB. There is a range of products like this.
Sensor Networks ◾ 437
is running, but only 15 μΑ in the sleep mode. To conserve energy, one can switch the mote
to one of the several sleep modes. These include the following:
1. IDLE mode that completely shuts off the processor and the radio.
2. POWER DOWN mode that shuts everything off except a watchdog timer. It can help
the processor set an alarm and wake up at an appropriate time.
In addition, researchers are constantly developing algorithmic solutions for energy
conservation
directed to specific applications. An additional technique is energy harvesting,
where ambient energy in the environment is converted into electrical energy to power
up the sensor nodes. Although the ambient energy is quite small (less than 100 μW/cm3),
this merits further investigation in certain forms of applications. Important sources of
ambient energy are solar, mechanical energy (vibration, finger movements), thermal energy
(temperature
gradients), etc.
20.2.2 ZigBee-Enabled Sensor Nodes
To facilitate the growth of wireless sensor networks in low-data-rate and low-power
applications, the ZigBee alliance proposed an open standard based on the IEEE 802.15.4
specification of the physical and the medium access control (MAC) layers. Low-data-rate
applications require sensor nodes to occasionally wake up and carry out an action, but
most of the time, they sleep. Numerous such applications are feasible in industrial controls,
medical devices, various alarm systems, and building automation. Due to the very low
power demand, such nodes are supposed to last for a year or more with a single set of
alkaline batteries. This is accomplished by carefully choosing the beaconing intervals and
various sleep modes. These standards have been well received by the industry—as a result,
many sensor nodes manufactured today are ZigBee compliant. An example is TelosB mote
developed by the University of California, Berkeley.
ZigBee nodes communicate at 2.4 GHz, 915 MHz, and 868 MHz using DSSS technology.
The 2.4 GHz band (also used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) is available worldwide and supports
a raw data rate of 250 kbps. The 915 MHz band supports applications in the United States
and some parts of Asia with a raw data rate of 40 kbps. The 868 MHz band is designed for

applications in Europe and supports a raw data rate of 20 kbps. ZigBee defines the lower
layers of the protocol suite. Specifically, it adds network structure, routing, and security
(e.g., key management and authentication) to complete the communications suite. On top
of this robust wireless engine, the target applications reside. ZigBee 1.0 protocol stack was
ratified in December 2004.
ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 support three kinds of devices: reduced functionality devices
(RFDs), full-functional devices (FFDs), and network coordinators. Most sensor nodes in
typical applications belong to the RFD class. An RFD is an end device that can only communicate
with its parent node or a significant neighbor, but cannot act as a router. An
FFD has the ability to act as a router. Finally, a network coordinator is the root of the
network tree and has the ability to serve as a bridge connecting with other networks. For
example, Stargate NetBridge is an embedded sensor network gateway device that connects
the MICA motes to an existing Ethernet network.
ZigBee supports three different kinds of network topologies: (1) star network, (2) cluster
tree (also known as a connected star), and (3) mesh network (Figure 20.2). A typical application
of the star configuration is a home security system. The cluster tree extends the tree
topology by connecting multiple star networks. Finally, the mesh network helps build a
sizeable system by accommodating a large number of wireless nodes and provides multiple
paths between nodes to facilitate reliable communication. ZigBee networking protocol
controls the topology by computing the most reliable paths and provides networks with
self-healing capabilities by spontaneously establishing alternate paths (if such a path exists)
whenever one or more nodes crash or the environmental conditions change.

tree. The white circles represent RFDs, the gray circles represent FFDs, and the black circles denote
network coordinators (base stations).
Sensor Networks ◾ 439
ZigBee supports three levels of security: (1) no security, (2) access control list (ACL), and
(3) 128-bit AES encryption with authentication. The choice of the appropriate security level
depends on the application and the resources available in the sensor nodes.
20.2.3 TinyOS® Operating System
TinyOS is an open-source component-based operating system for wireless sensor networks
and is designed to operate under severe memory constraints. It supports networking,
power management, and sensor interfacing for developing application programs. TinyOS
is event driven—it consists of a scheduler and several components. Each component
(Figure 20.3) consists of
a. Event handlers to propagate hardware events to the upper levels
b. Command handlers to send requests to lower-level components
c. Tasks related to the application
A component has a set of interfaces for connecting to other components: this includes (1)
interfaces that it provides for other components and (2) interfaces that it uses (there are
provided by other components). Typically, commands are requests to start an operation
and events signal the completion of an operation. For example, to send a packet, a component
invokes the send command that initiates the send, and another component signals
the event of completing the send operation. A program has two threads of execution: one
executes the tasks, and the other handles events. Task scheduling policy is FIFO. A task
cannot preempt another task, but an event handler can preempt a task and other event
handlers too.
TinyOS is programmed in NesC, an extension of the C language that integrates reactivity
to the environment, concurrency, and communication. Components are accessed via
their interface points. TinyOS has two types of components: modules and configurations.
A module provides the implementation of one or more interfaces, and a configuration
defines how the modules are connected together to implement the application. As an example,

20.3 CHALLENGES IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
This section highlights some of the important challenges faced by applications that use
wireless sensor networks.
20.3.1 Energy Conservation
Algorithms running on sensor networks should be energy-aware for maximum battery
life. Sensing, computation, and (radio) communication are three cornerstones of sensor
network technology. Of these, sensing and computation are power thrifty, but communication
is not.
The radio model for a sensor node is as follows: if Ed is the minimum energy needed to
communicate with a node at a distance d, then Ed = K ⋅ dn. Here, n is a parameter whose
value ranges between 2 and 4 depending on environmental parameters, and K depends on
the characteristics of the transmitter.
For a given transmission energy, the radio range forms a disk (Figure 20.4a). All nodes
within the radio range are neighbors of the sending node. The disk model is however somewhat
simplistic—variations in the environmental characteristics (like the presence of objects
Sensor Networks ◾ 443
or obstructions) can distort the contour. Also, there are sensor nodes equipped with directional
antennas—these are more efficient in transmitting in certain directions. However,
unless otherwise mentioned, we will ignore these refinements and stick to the disk model.
As a consequence of the Ed = K ⋅ dn formula, the shortest Euclidean path between a pair
of nodes is not necessarily the minimum-energy path. For example, in Figure 20.4b, if
n > 2, then the path ACB between A and B will consume lesser energy compared to the
direct path AB between them. The task of identifying an appropriate topology that reduces
energy consumption and satisfies certain connectivity or routing requirements is the goal
of topology control.
Studies on existing sensor hardware reveal that communicating a single bit across
20 ft costs as much energy as required in the execution of 1000 instructions. Therefore,
minimizing
communication is a major focus in energy conservation. Conventional
textbook
models and algorithms are often inadequate for many sensor network applications.
For example, shared memory algorithms require each process to constantly read the
states of the neighbors, which steadily drains battery power. Message-passing algorithms
optimize performance in terms of number of point-to-point messages, but do not use (or
rarely use) local multicasts to the immediate neighborhood, which are clearly more energy
efficient. This is because each point-to-point message is as expensive (in terms of power
consumption) as a local multicast. Another technique for energy conservation is aggregation.
An aggregation point collects sensor readings from a subset of nodes and forwards
a single message by combining these values. For example, if multiple copies of the same
data are independently forwarded to a base station, then an intermediate node can act
as aggregation
point by suppressing the transmission of duplicate copies and thus reduce
energy consumption. Furthermore, energy-aware algorithms must utilize the various
power-saving modes supported by its operating system.
20.3.2 Fault Tolerance
Disasters not only affect a geographic region but also affect the monitoring infrastructure
that includes the sensor nodes and the network. Node failures and environmental hazards

444 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
cause frequent topology change, communication failure, and network partition, adding to
the fragility of wireless sensor networks. Such perturbations are far more frequent than
those found in traditional LAN or WAN. Due to the ad hoc nature of the network, selfstabilization
is a promising method for restoring consistency. Tolerating failures and perturbations
and maintaining the fidelity of information in spite of the fragile nature of the
environment are fundamental goals of sensor networks.
20.3.3 Routing
Routing strategies in sensor networks differ from those in ordinary networks. Conventional
routing is address-centric, where data are directed to or retrieved from certain designated
nodes. Routing in sensor networks, however, is mostly data-centric—the base station queries
the network for a particular type of data (and may not care about which node generates
that data), and the appropriate sensor nodes route the data back to the base station. Reliable
routing requires identification of reliable data channels, energy-efficient routing requires
data aggregation, and fault-tolerant routing relies on the network’s ability to discover alternative
routes and self-organize when an existing route fails.
20.3.4 Time Synchronization
Several applications on sensor networks require synchronized clocks with high precision.
For example, the precise online tracking of fast-moving objects requires a precision of
1 μs or better. Unfortunately, low-cost sensor nodes are resource thrifty and do not have
a built-
in precision clock—a clock is implemented by incrementing a register at regular
intervals driven by the built-in oscillator. With such simple clocks, the required precision
is not achievable by traditional synchronization techniques (like NTP). Furthermore, clock
synchronization algorithms designed for LAN and WAN are not energy-aware. GPS is
expensive and not affordable by the low-cost nodes. Also GPS does not work in an indoor
setting since a clear sky view is absent.
20.3.5 Location Management
The deployment of a sensor network establishes a physical association of the sensor nodes
with the objects in the application zone. Identifying the spatial coordinates of the objects,
called localization, has numerous applications in tracking. The challenge is to locate an
object with high precision. GPS is not usable inside large buildings and lacks the precision
desired in some applications.
20.3.6 Middleware Design
Applications interact with the sensor network through appropriately designed middleware.
A query like What is the carbon monoxide level in room 1739? is easy to handle with an
appropriate location management infrastructure. However, a data-centric query Which
area has temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees? needs to be translated into low-level
actions by the individual sensors, so that the response is generated fast and with minimum
energy consumption. This is the job of the middleware.
Sensor Networks ◾ 445
20.3.7 Security
Radio links are insecure. This means that an adversary can steal data from the network,
inject data into the network, or replay old packets. Adversarial acts include surreptitiously
planting malicious nodes that can alter the goals of the network. Such nodes can either be
new nodes that did not belong to the original network, or these can be existing nodes that
were captured by the adversary, and their memory contents altered with malicious codes.
Another tool for the attack is a laptop-class node with high-quality wireless communication
links—it can hoodwink other nodes into false beliefs about the network topology
and force them to forward data to the attacker. The threats are numerous and need to be
countered using lightweight tools, since sensor nodes have limited resources to implement
countermeasures.
20.4 ROUTING ALGORITHMS
In wireless sensor networks, a base station (sometimes called a sink node) sends commands
to and receives data from the sensor nodes. A primitive method of routing (data or commands)
is flooding, which is unattractive from the energy efficiency point of view. A better
alternative is gossiping, where intermediate nodes forward data to their neighbors with a
certain probability. Compared to flooding, gossiping uses fewer messages, and so consumes
less energy. For reliable message delivery and energy efficiency, numerous routing methods
have been proposed so far. In this section, we present some well-known routing algorithms.
20.4.1 Directed Diffusion
Directed diffusion was proposed by Intanagonwiwat et al. [IGE+02] for data monitoring
and collection in response of data-centric queries. Assume that a sensor network has been
deployed to monitor intrusion in a sensitive area. A sink node sends out queries about its
interests down a sensor network to the appropriate nodes. The intermediate nodes cache
these interests. A typical interest has a default monitoring rate and an expiration time. An
example is monitor the northwest quadrant of the field for intrusion every minute until midnight.
This dissemination of interests sets up gradients (a mechanism for tagging preferred
paths based on their responsiveness) in the network (Figure 20.5). Data are named using
attribute–value pairs. As sensor nodes generate data, the various paths transfer data with
matching interests toward the originator of the interest. Depending on the responsiveness
of these paths (or the importance of the event), a receiving node reinforces only a small
fraction of the gradients. It does so by resending the interest with a higher asking rate. The
reinforced gradients define the preferred links for data collection. This also prunes some
neighbors since the interests in their caches will expire after some time. For example, if
node i does not detect any intrusion but node j does, then the gradient toward node j is
reinforced. Accordingly, in directed diffusion, with the progress of time, all data do not
propagate uniformly in every direction. The gradient is represented by a tuple (rate, duration),
where rate denoted the frequency at which data are desired and duration designates
the expiration time of the request. A higher rate encourages data transmission, and a lower
rate inhibits data transmission.
446 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Implementers can use various heuristics for quantifying gradient. During the initial
propagation of an interest from the sink to the sources, all gradients (i.e., their rates) have
the same value. In Figure 20.5, when the sink disseminates the interest, all links have a
gradient with rate 1. When node 6 discovers that link (8,6) provides the desired data with
a lower delay, it increases the gradient of that link to a higher value. Thereafter, node 3
discovers that the data arrive through link (6,3) with a lower delay compared to the other
links incident on it. So, it increases the gradient of link (6,3). In this process, eventually
links (3,4), (4,2), and (2,0) are reinforced. New paths transmitting high-quality data get
spontaneously reinforced, and poor-quality paths automatically drop out from the scene.
That directed diffusion consumes less energy compared to flooding is no surprise.
Intanagonwiwat et al. [IGE+02] reports that it also consumes less energy compared to
omniscient multicast.
20.4.2 Cluster-Based Routing
Cluster-based routing, also known as hierarchical routing, uses a two-level approach for
routing data from the sensor nodes to the base station. The network is partitioned into
clusters: each cluster has a cluster head, and a few nodes associated with it. The cluster
heads receive data from the nodes in the cluster, aggregate them, and send them to neighboring
cluster heads. Eventually, the data get forwarded to the base station. If the clocks are
synchronized, then intercluster communication can be scheduled at predefined time slots.
Cluster-based routing is energy efficient, scalable, and robust.
20.4.2.1 LEACH
Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is a self-organizing routing protocol
that uses the idea of hierarchical routing (Figure 20.6a). It uses randomization to distribute
the energy load evenly among the sensors. The protocol runs in phases. The first phase
elects the cluster heads. The second phase sets up the cluster: here, each cluster head sends
out advertisements inviting other nodes to join its cluster. A noncluster node makes the
decision depending on the energy needed to communicate with a cluster head—the cluster
head that is reachable using the minimum energy is its best choice for that node. In
the third phase, the cluster heads agree to a time schedule for transmission—the schedule
helps avoid conflicts caused by overlapped transmission. The nodes that are not cluster

highest gradient and is the preferred route for data transfer from a source to the sink.
Sensor Networks ◾ 447
heads are notified about this schedule, which enables them to transmit data at appropriate
times. The cluster heads are responsible for data aggregation and data compression, so that
multiple data are bundled into a single message. LEACH saves energy via a reduction in the
number of transmissions, and this extends the life of the network.
The cluster heads transmit the data directly to the base station (Figure 20.6a), so this is
a high-energy transmission. They spend more energy than the rest of the nodes, running
the risk of draining their battery sooner than others and causing a network partition. To
prevent this imbalance in energy drainage, cluster heads are rotated via periodic reelection.
When the residual power in a cluster head reaches below a certain level, a new cluster head is
elected. Nodes with significant residual energy are expected to volunteer for becoming new
cluster heads. This helps with energy load balancing and increases the life of the application.
20.4.2.2 PEGASIS
Power-Efficient GAthering in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS) is an improvement
over LEACH in the sense that it requires less energy per round of data transmission. The
sensor nodes form a chain, so that each node communicates with a close neighbor by
spending a small amount of energy. Gathered data move from node to node and get fused,
and eventually, a designated node (called the leader) transmits the data packet to the base
station (Figure 20.6b). Nodes take turns to be the leader—this reduces the average energy
spent by each node per round and balances the load. The task of building a chain that
will expend the minimum energy to collect data can be reduced to the traveling salesman
problem, which is known to be intractable; PEGASIS therefore uses a greedy protocol to
form such chains, makes use of a variety of aggregation methods, and claims to reduce the
per-round energy consumption of LEACH by a factor of 2 or better.

20.4.3 Metadata-Based Routing: SPIN
Sensor protocol for information via negotiation (SPIN) defines a family of protocols that
overcomes redundant data transmission (the major weak point of flooding or gossiping) by
using metadata for negotiation before any actual data are transmitted. Two major problems
with flooding or gossiping are as follows:
1. Implosion: A node receives multiple copies of the same data via different channels.
2. Conflict: Multiple senders simultaneously send data to the same destination node.
Although there is 1-1 correspondence between real data and metadata, the protocol
assumes that metadata are much smaller in size—therefore, less energy is expended in
transmitting or receiving metadata compared to real data. Three types of data packets are
used in SPIN:
1. ADV: It is a metadata advertisement for new data to be shared.
2. REQ: A node sends a metadata REQ (request for data) when it wishes to receive an
advertised data.
3. DATA: This is the real data with a metadata header.
SPIN uses a simple handshake protocol for data transmission. This is based on the sequence
ADV–REQ–DATA. Data are sent only when a request is received based on metadata. If a
node already received a copy of that data, then it does not send REQ, which suppresses data
transmission. This naturally eliminates implosion. Conflict is avoided by sending REQ to
only one sender at any time. In case of data loss, the protocol allows nodes a second chance
to retrieve the data by sending a REQ to a duplicate ADV.
An enhanced version of SPIN allows the application to adapt to the current energy level
of the node. It adapts itself based on amount of residual energy—participation in sending
ADV or REQ is restricted when the residual energy level becomes low. Simulation results
show that it is more energy efficient than flooding or gossiping while distributing data at
the same rate or faster.
Finally, geometric ad hoc routing characterizes a class of routing algorithms where the
nodes are location-aware, that is, each node knows its own location, the locations of its
immediate neighbors, and that of the destination. There are several algorithms belonging
to this class (e.g., see GOAFR+ [KWZ+03]).
20.5 TIME SYNCHRONIZATION USING REFERENCE BROADCAST
A few applications of wireless sensor networks rely on accurate synchronization among
the local clocks for their success. The desired synchronization is much tighter than what
we need for machines on the Internet. A protocol like NTP can synchronize clocks within
an accuracy of a few milliseconds, whereas some critical sensor network applications need
Sensor Networks ◾ 449
clocks to be synchronized within 1–2 ms. Examples of critical applications that require
precise time synchronization are as follows:
• Time of flight of sound: How much time did it take for sound to reach from point A to
B? Such measurements are important for echo depth sounding that accurately maps
out the bottom of a lake or an ocean.
• Velocity and trajectory estimate: A sniper fired a bullet toward a particular target in a
busy location. From which window of the nearly multistoried building was the bullet
possibly fired? The accuracy of the computation will depend on how closely the clocks
of the sensor nodes sensing the bullet are synchronized.
• TDMA schedule: To avoid frame collisions and the consequent loss of message and
energy, it is important for a cluster of sensor nodes to agree on a common TDMA
schedule. To enforce such a schedule, all nodes have to agree to a common time frame.
For external synchronization (i.e., synchronization with a precise external time source),
the nodes in a sensor networks can use GPS. However, apart from the additional cost, it
is not feasible to access GPS data in indoor applications, or certain urban locations, or in
hostile territories where GPS signals may be jammed.
20.5.1 Reference Broadcast
Reference broadcast (RBS)–based time synchronization provides a solution to time synchronization
when external synchronization is not important, and only internal synchronization
is adequate. RBS uses a broadcast message to synchronize the clocks of a set of
receivers with one another. This is in contrast with traditional protocols that synchronize a
receiver with the sender of the message. In the simplest form, RBS has three steps:
1. A transmitter broadcasts a reference packet to a set of nodes.
2. Each receiver records its local time when the broadcast is received.
3. The receivers exchange these local times with one another.
RBS recognizes that a message broadcast on the physical layer arrives at a set of receiving
nodes with very little variability in propagation delay (Figure 20.7a). Four components of
time are taken into consideration during time synchronization:
Send time: Time to construct and transfer the message to the network interface.
Access time: Time spent in waiting for the transmission channel.
Propagation time: Actual flight time of the signal from the source to the destination
node.
Receive time: Time required by the network interface to signal message arrival to the
host.
450 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Unlike the Internet, message propagation time in sensor networks is of the order of a few
nanoseconds and is therefore negligible. The other three components are more or less the
same for all receiving nodes. The phase offset can be accurately deduced from a series of m
RBS over n distinct sensor nodes. Let Ti,k and Tj,k be the local times of a pair of sensor nodes
(i, j) when they receive the RBS from a node k. Then the average offset between nodes i and
j from the reception of the RBS from m different nodes is

( , , )
The largest of these values represents the group dispersion. The mean dispersion is used to
reset the clocks to the correct value.
Sensor nodes do not have built-in precise clocks—once the clocks are synchronized, due
to the disparity in the oscillator frequencies, the clock skew will get worse over time. To
keep the skew within tolerable limits, the clocks have to be periodically resynchronized.
Experiments showed that with only two sensor nodes, by using 30 RBS, RBS could achieve
an accuracy of 1.6 ms, beyond which it reaches a zone of diminishing return. Details of
these experiments are available in [EGE02].
The previous method works for a single broadcast domain only. What about multiple
broadcast domains? Figure 20.7b shows two broadcast domains overlapping with each
other. Let Refs A and B send out the RBS in their respective domains. To relate the timings
in these two domains, observations made by some node 2 that is common to both domains
are crucial. As an example, let node 1 receive a message (at time T1) 100 ms after receiving
the RBS from A (T1 = Ref A + 100 ms), and let node 3 observe an event (at time T3) 600 ms
before receiving the RBS from B (T3 = Ref B − 600 ms). Both 1 and 3 will consult
node 2
that received both RBS and find out that node 2 received the broadcast from A 1000 ms
before the broadcast from node B (Ref A = Ref B − 1000 ms). From these, it follows
that
T3 − T1 = 1000 − 600 − 100 = 300 ms.

the broadcast from Ref B, and node 2 receives the broadcast from Ref A 1000 ms before receiving the
broadcast from Ref B.
Sensor Networks ◾ 451
Although designed to provide internal synchronization, RBS can also achieve external
synchronization when one of the sensor nodes is equipped with a GPS receiver that can
receive the UTC signal.
20.6 LOCALIZATION ALGORITHMS
Localization binds spatial coordinates with sensed data and is an important component in
many applications of sensor networks. The central issue is to answer queries like “Where
is this signal coming from, or where is an intruder currently located in this area?” Spatial
coordinates are also useful for collaborative signal processing algorithms that combine
data from multiple sensor nodes for the purpose of target tracking. The required coordinates
might be absolute or relative. It is implied that GPS is not attractive due to its cost, or
physical size, or accuracy, or power consumption, or the absence of a clear sky view. In this
section, we outline the principles of a few location management systems.
20.6.1 RSSI-Based Ranging
The simplest method of computing the distance of one node from another uses received
signal strength indicator (RSSI). While sending out a signal, the sending node appends
the strength of the sending signal. Given a model of how the signal strength fades with
distance, the receiving node can compute its distance from the sender. One major problem
here is the poor correlation between the RSSI and the distance. The accuracy is highly
affected by the variability of the wireless medium. The problem is further compounded by
the manufacturing variances of the radio devices and multipath effect (caused by reflection
from neighboring objects).
20.6.2 Ranging Using Time Difference of Arrival
If the local clocks are synchronized and the sender sends a time-stamped signal, then the
receiver can potentially compute the time of flight and deduce the distance separating
them. In practice, this does not work well, since clocks are rarely synchronized with an
accuracy <1 μs, whereas the time of flight is of the order of nanoseconds. A much better
accuracy is achieved using a combination of radio and acoustic waves. The Active Bat
system is the first implementation of this concept. Each bat is tagged with a unique id, a
radio receiver, and ultrasound transducers. The interrogator sends a query via radio “Bat
32, send (ultrasound) signal now.” Bat 32 complies, the time of flight of the ultrasound is
recorded by the interrogator, and the distance of the bat is computed from it. The technique
is accurate and does not require time synchronization as long as clocks are stable over
short periods of time. The indoor location system CRICKET [PCB00] at MIT used this
approach to locate and track indoor objects with an accuracy of a few centimeters.
20.6.3 Anchor-Based Ranging
A straightforward scheme for localization uses a coordinate system defined by a set of
powerful
nodes called beacons. The beacons serve as anchors and are positioned at known
points in the area of interest. These beacons periodically broadcast their current coordinates.
The spatial location of a sensor node is determined by (1) how many distinct broadcasts it
452 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
can receive and (2) the strength of the signals received for each broadcast. It is important
that the sensor node receives at least three broadcasts from distinct beacons (Figure 20.8).
Using a direct ranging method like RSSI, the sensor node estimates its distances dA, dB, dC
from the three anchors A, B, and C, respectively. If (x, y) is the coordinate of the sensor
node in a given coordinate system and (xA, yA), (xB, yB), (xC, yC) are the coordinates of the
anchors A, B, and C, respectively, then the following equations hold:

Computation of (x, y) by solving these equations is known as triangulation or lateration.
Lateration produces good results only when the distance estimates are accurate.
Unfortunately, simple RSSI-based ranging method is not accurate. The accuracy of measurement
can be increased if there are more than three anchors within the radio range of a
sensor. This generalization is known as multilateration.
If the network contains multiple broadcast domains and the density of anchors is low,
then the sensor node will obtain its distance from the anchors over multiple hops. To use
lateration in such cases, each anchor maintains a shortest path tree with itself as the root.
Distance from the anchors is estimated via the shortest paths.
20.7 SECURITY IN SENSOR NETWORKS
Most simple applications of sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks, since they have not
been originally designed with security as a goal. The description of threats relates to a typical
setup where a base station collects data from a bunch of sensor nodes in the physical
space. We assume that the base station is always trustworthy.
One can classify adversaries into three different classes: passive, active, and malicious.
A passive adversary quietly steals unprotected data, or tampers data in transit,
or launches a replay attack. Active adversaries can inflict much more damage. They can

FIGURE 20.8 The sensor k receives signals from the beacons A, B, and C.
Sensor Networks ◾ 453
(physically) capture a node, extract the codes and keys, steal protected information using
the stolen keys, or launch an attack by planting malicious codes into the captured nodes.
PC-class adversaries can remotely influence many nodes and launch sinkhole or wormhole
attacks by faking route information. Malicious adversaries try to harm the network.
This includes (1) draining one or more nodes of energy and thus causing network partitions,
(2) tampering with the data (possibly in critical services like power plants, water
supplies, hospitals) that could potentially harm the intended application, or (3) jamming
the signals and disrupting communication in critical applications like anti-theft monitoring
or military surveillance applications, so that an enemy can launch future attacks
on the application without much difficulty. This section reviews a few security measures
for sensor networks.
20.7.1 SPIN for Data Security
Due to limited resources, the implementation of conventional cryptographic protocols is
impractical on sensor nodes: for example, effective public keys are long, and the communication
overhead as well as the computation effort for its verification is very high. Only
fast secret-key cryptography can be sparingly used. In [PSW+02], Perrig et al. introduced a
cryptographic protocol (called SPIN) to secure sensor networks against passive adversaries.
SPIN was designed to preserve confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and freshness (of
data). The protocol works on a traditional setup where a base station communicates with the
sensor nodes via source routing. Some sensor nodes may not be trustworthy. Messages may
be corrupted in transit, but all messages are eventually delivered to the destination node.
SPIN consists of two components: a sensor network encryption protocol (SNEP) and
μTESLA (microversion of Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication). A brief
description follows:
20.7.1.1 Overview of SNEP
SNEP provides confidentiality (privacy), two-party data authentication, integrity, and
freshness. Each node j shares a unique master key Kj with the base station. This master key
is used to derive all other keys: these include the data encryption key, the MAC key, and
a key for random number generation. SNEP derives a one-time encryption key using the
value of a monotonically increasing message counter and the master key. This key is XOR-ed
with the message bits and sent out. The message counter value is not explicitly transmitted,
but the communicating processes independently keep track of it, and the eavesdropper
has no knowledge about it. The recipient generates an identical key and XORs it with the
ciphertext to retrieve the clear text. This preserves confidentiality. SNEP has the following
properties:
1. Since the same message gets transformed to different ciphertext in different transmissions,
cryptanalysis via plaintext attack is ruled out. This helps achieve semantic security.
2. Replay attacks can be identified due to the use of the shared counter in the transmitted
message.
454 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
3. Message delivery guarantees weak freshness. Since the counter monotonically
increases, the recipient only knows that the current message is more recent than the
previous one, but does not know who transmitted it. The use of a nonce (using a random
number generator) will guarantee strong freshness.
After some evaluation, RC5 was chosen as the block cipher due to the small size of the code.
The communication overhead of SNEP was 8 bytes per message.
20.7.1.2 Overview of μTESLA
This is a lightweight version of the TESLA protocol for authenticated broadcast that
was designed for more heavy-duty platforms. Traditional authentication (mostly) uses
asymmetric
key cryptography, which is not feasible for the resource-constrained sensor
nodes. μTESLA uses symmetric key and authenticates messages by introducing asymmetry
through a novel method that involves delayed disclosure of the symmetric keys. Each
MAC key is an element of a key chain that is generated using a public one-way function F.
Consider a communication from the base station to the participant nodes in the network,
and assume that the local clocks are approximately synchronized. The sender generates
keys at regular time intervals, and there is a 1-1 correspondence between keys and time
slots* (Figure 20.9). μTESLA generates the MAC key K(m) for interval m (m>0) using the formula
K(m) = F(K(m−1)). Here, F is a one-way function—everybody can compute K(m−1) from
K(m), but only the base station can derive K(m) from K(m−1). When the base station sends out a
packet at interval 0 using the MAC key K(0), the receiving node cannot authenticate it since
it does not have the verification key. However, it is also true that no eavesdropper knows
about it, so no one else could have generated the data. The receiving node simply buffers it.
Each verification key is disclosed after a couple of time intervals. For example, in
Figure 20.9, the key K(0) has been disclosed after one time interval, after which the receiving
node(s) can authenticate the buffered message sent with MAC key K(0). The loss of some
of the packets disclosing the keys is not a problem. For example, if both K(0) and K(1) are lost,
but the packet disclosing K(2) is received, then the receiving node(s) can easily generate K(1)
and K(0) from it and complete the authentication.
20.7.2 Attacks on Routing
An active adversary can alter routing information (or plant fake routing information) to create
routing loops, attract network traffic toward compromised nodes, or divert traffic through one
or more target nodes for draining their energy and partitioning the network. There are several

different types of attack that seem feasible. In a selective forwarding attack, the adversary
(a compromised
node) drops important data packets to cause damage to the application.
Sinkhole attacks lure network traffic toward compromised nodes, so that they can do whatever
they wish with the data. To launch a sinkhole attack, a compromised node will falsely send out
(or replay) an advertisement of a high-quality path to the base station. Wormhole attacks create
the illusion of a high-quality route by tunneling the data from one part of the network to
another remote part via a low latency link. This link will use an out-of-bound channel that is
only accessible to the attacker. The low latency path will attract traffic and create a wormhole.
Wormhole attacks are likely to be combined with eavesdropping or selective forwarding.
20.7.2.1 Hello Flood
Many applications require nodes to periodically broadcast heartbeat (HELLO) messages.
A PC-class adversary broadcasting such a message to a large number of nodes in the network
can convince every such node that it is a neighbor. When this adversary advertises a
high-quality route leading to the base station, other nodes will adopt this route and send
their data to the adversary, which may never be forwarded to a destination. It effectively
creates a sinkhole (also called a black hole) using a slightly different method.
While all of the previous attacks take place in the network layer, protocols in other layers
are also susceptible to attack. For example, jamming attacks the physical layer, and the use
of DSSS helps avoid it (unless the attacker knows the precise hopping sequence). In addition
to these general attacks, specific algorithms can also be attacked. Some of these attacks
are easy to defend, but for many others, effective countermeasures are necessary. Finding
effective countermeasures is an important topic of research.
20.8 APPLICATIONS
In recent times, wireless sensor networks are being increasingly used, in many cases on
an experimental basis, in health-care, sustainability, and surveillance-related applications.
There is a growing effort to build smart applications that require less human intervention,
yet achieve the same or a higher level of efficiency in terms of end goal or energy usage.
A small fraction of these applications is summarized in the following.
20.8.1 Health-Care Applications
Wearable ambulatory medical sensors enable people to monitor important physiological
parameters while engaged in the activities of everyday life. These target fitness enthusiasts
as well as aging populations who are concerned about their health. Such embedded sensors
are capable of communicating with smartphones or PDAs using short-range technologies
like Bluetooth. Even prosthetic devices with embedded sensors have emerged. For
the aging population, wireless communication enables medical data to be transmitted to
caregivers, facilitating ubiquitous real-time sensing. As an example, Harvard University’s
CodeBlue project [GPS+08] integrated various medical sensors with mote-class devices.
A publish-/subscribe-based network architecture supports data dissemination with different
priorities and remote sensor control. CodeBlue also allows victims of disasters to be
tracked and localized using radio-frequency-based localization techniques.
456 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
In epidemiology, the failure to comply with appropriate hand hygiene by the healthcare
workers in the hospitals leads to millions of infections that are preventable. At the
University of Iowa, the computational epidemiology group has developed a wireless-motebased
data-collection system to capture health-care worker hand-hygiene behavior along
with health-care worker interactions over time and space [HNS+12].
20.8.2 Environment Monitoring and Control
With the growth of cloud computing and cloud-based services, the number of data centers
is rapidly increasing. Each data center has thousands of servers, and these servers consume
a substantial amount of energy. This generates heat, and to prevent overheating, cooling
becomes essential, which costs energy. In fact, energy is the single largest operating expense
for most data centers. Improving the energy performance of data center systems reduces
the operating costs as well as cuts down greenhouse gas emission. Sensors placed near the
servers relay the data about energy consumption and climatic conditions to a base station
that initiates appropriate measures for fine-grained climatic control to conserve energy.
Studies sponsored by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) have shown that energy consumption can be reduced by 25%
through implementation of best practices and commercially available technologies.
20.8.3 Citizen Sensing
Citizen sensing or people-centric sensing aims at sensing and collecting various kinds of
environmental data that are of interest to the citizens of a community in their daily lives.
Several projects have addressed this issue. These include the urban sensing project at the
Center for Embedded Network Sensing (CENS), the University of California at Los Angeles,
the Hourglass project at Harvard, the CarTel project at MIT [HBC+06], and Dartmouth’s
MetroSense project [CEL+08]. Each one of these developed an infrastructure for general purpose
sensing at Internet scale. Sustainable design, healthy living, and effective stewardship
of the world’s limited resources require a solid understanding of how countless individual
actions generate global effects and how individuals relate to their local environments—both
natural and man-made. Citizen sensing targets technologies and applications that increase
our capacity to help individuals, families, and communities monitor and improve their
health, monitor pollution, adopt sustainable practices in resource consumption, and participate
in civic processes. Data collection and analysis uses, in addition to sensors embedded
at various locations, everyday technologies like mobile phones and automobiles, and some
of these projects allow individuals to decide what, where, and when to sense.
20.8.4 Pursuer–Evader Game
Pursuer–evader game is an online tracking system relevant to disaster management. Here,
the rescuers pursue or track the hot spots in a disaster zone (these are the evaders). The goal
of the pursuer is to catch the evader using the information gathered by a sensor network. If
the evader is successfully tracked down, then the rescue/recovery begins. Demirbas et al.
[DAG03] proposed the first set of solutions to the problem. This section outlines the problem
specifications and presents one of their solutions.
Sensor Networks ◾ 457
Assume that the topology of the sensor network is a connected graph. The pursuer and the
evader are two distinguished entities moving around in the Euclidean space that is constantly
being monitored by the sensor nodes. In each step, these entities are able to move from the
radio range of one sensor node to the radio range of a neighboring node* (Figure 20.10). Nodes
may crash, or their states may be altered by transient failures. Exactly one node can sense the
presence of the pursuer or the evader at any time. We further assume that the evader is omniscient—
it knows the network topology as well as the current location of the pursuer and can
pick appropriate moves to distance itself from the pursuer. However, the pursuer does not have
much knowledge beyond its immediate neighborhood, and nobody has any knowledge about
the strategy of the evader. The pursuer catches the evader when both of them reach the radio
range of the same sensor node. The reaction time of the sensor nodes is much smaller than
the time needed by the evader or the pursuer to move—so we assume that each sensor node
executes an action or detects the evader within its range in zero time. Furthermore, the pursuer
moves faster than the evader, and the local clocks of the sensor nodes are synchronized.
The evader-centric solution proposed in [DAG03] is as follows: the motes collectively
maintain a tracking tree rooted at the evader. As the evader moves, the motes detect it and
reconfigure the tracking tree. The pursuer moves up the tree edges to reach the evader at
the root. The two activities run concurrently.
For each node k, we use the following notations:
• Evader @k (or pursuer @k) designates that currently, the evader (or the pursuer) is
residing in the radio range of node k.
• N(k) represents the neighbors of node k.
• P(k) parent of a node k in the tracking tree.
• T(k) designates the time when the evader was last seen. This information can be
obtained from direct observation or through indirect observation via a neighbor.
• d(k) represents that node’s hop distance from the root via tree edges.
* In real life, this is not necessarily true—it is a simplifying assumption only.

458 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The programs of the evader, the pursuer, and the sensor nodes are presented as follows:
{The evader’s program}
{Evader moves from one node to another}
do evader@j → evader@k : k ∈ N(j) od
{The program of a sensor node j}
initially T(j) = 0{This is a simplifying assumption only}
do evader@j → P(j):= j ;T(j) = clock of j;
[] ∃k ∈ N(j):(T(j) < T(k) ∨ T(j) = T(k) ∧ d(j) > d(k) + 1)→
P(j):= k; T(j):= T(P(j)); d(j):= d(P(j)) + 1
od
{The pursuer’s program}
{Pursuer moves to the parent node in the tree}
do pursuer@j→pursuer@P(j) od
Assume that the system runs under a distributed scheduler that allows maximal parallelism,
so that all eligible nodes execute their actions in each step. Then the following results
hold for the previous algorithm:
Lemma 20.1
After a node detects the evader, a tracking tree is formed in at most D steps, where D is the
diameter of the sensor network.
Proof outline: We first argue that the edges joining a sensor node with its parent induce
a spanning tree in the network. Since ∀k : d(k) = d(P(k)) + 1, in the steady state, there will
be no cycle involving the edges between the nodes k and P(k). Also, ∀k : T(P(k)) ≥ T(k),
and no time stamp can exceed that of the root. Therefore, any node will have a directed
path from itself to the root by following the parent pointers. Once a node detects the
evader and becomes the root, the farthest node is guaranteed to adjust its d and P values
within D steps. ◾
Theorem 20.1
Let M be the initial separation between the pursuer and the evader and α be the ratio
between the speed of the evader and that of the pursuer (α < 1). Then, the pursuer catches
the evader in at most M + 2M × ⌈α/(1−α)⌉ steps.
Proof outline: As a consequence of Lemma 20.1, the pursuer takes at most M steps to
orient
its parent pointer in the right direction. By that time, the evader may move at most
M steps away, so the distance between the pursuer and the evader may grow to at most 2M.
Once the separation grows to the maximum, the hop distance between the pursuer and
the evader can never increase thereafter. To see why, consider a path j, j + 1, j + 2, …,
k − 1, k between the evader j and the pursuer k. Actions taken by either of them can only
reduce the length of the path—if j moves away, then eventually, k closes in, since it is faster
Sensor Networks ◾ 459
than j. So, in reality, the hop distance will eventually decrease. If x is the number of steps
until the evader is caught after the chase begins, then in the same time, the purser will
cover 2M + x steps, whereas the evader can take at most x steps. Thus, α = x/(2M + x). So,
x = 2M ⋅ α/(1−α). Add to it the initial number of M steps that the pursuer took before it
correctly
oriented its parent pointer, and the result follows. ◾
This algorithm is however not energy efficient. In each step, every node has to broadcast
to each of its neighbors (the shared memory simplifies program writing, but true communication
takes place via message passing). The original paper by the authors contains
algorithms that are more energy efficient than this, but the pursuit is slower.
20.9 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Sensor network technology is growing at a rapid pace. Energy conservation remains a
challenge
in computationally intensive applications, and the quest for more powerful sensor
nodes, better batteries, and better sensors continues. Energy harvesting from the environment
remains an attractive option for solving the energy problem in certain classes of applications.
Also, security issues are receiving increased attention as the technology is making
inroads into sensitive areas like medical applications or surveillance-related activities.
A related device that plays a supporting role in some embedded systems is the
radio-
frequency identification tag (RFID). An RFID is a small tag that can be attached to
a physical object—the tag contains the description of that object (like manufacturer, type,
serial number). The antenna on the tag enables it to receive and respond to radio-frequency
signals from an RFID reader. Passive tags have no internal power source. They are cheaper
and have a smaller range (a few feet), but active tags have internal power sources and a
much larger range (a 100 ft or more). RFIDs can potentially enhance the development of
some sensor network applications in embedded systems.

EXERCISES
20.1 Consider the placement of the sensor nodes on a 2D grid (Figure 20.11):
Let Ed
= K ⋅ d3 where Ed is the energy needed to send data at a distance d and the
energy needed to receive data is negligible. Then determine how the data from A to
B should be routed so that the total energy spent by all the nodes in the path is the
minimum. How will the route change if the energy equation is Ed = K ⋅ d1.9?
20.2 Consider a tree construction algorithm with the base station as the root. The base
station initiates the construction by sending out beacons. Each node chooses
another node from which it receives a beacon packet with the lowest hop count as its
parent node. The plan is that sensor data will be forwarded towards the base station
via the parent node via a BFS tree.
Unfortunately, links are not always bidirectional: if node A receives a signal from
node B, then B may not receive the transmission from A. As a result, this tree will
not ensure reliable data collection from all the nodes in the tree to the root. Modify
the algorithm to construct a tree that enables reliable data collection from all the
sensors nodes.

20.4 Uncoordinated transmissions can interfere with one another, causing conflicts
in the MAC layer. When two neighbors concurrently transmit or a node receives
concurrent
transmissions from two other nodes, the messages are garbled. This
triggers message retransmission and wastes energy.
Consider the network of Figure 20.12a. Assuming that the local clocks are
synchronized,
consider coordinating the transmissions to avoid such conflicts
using TDMA. Your answer should specify which time slots can be used by a node to
transmit data. Your goal should be to maximize the transmission rate.
a. If time is divided into five slots—0, 1, 2, 3, and 4—as shown in Figure 20.12b, then
find an assignment of the slots for the nodes in the network shown in part (a).

and (50, 60), respectively (Figure 20.13). Using RSSI, a sensor node finds out that its
distances from A, B, C, and D are 20, 40, 35, and 45 units, respectively. Show how the
sensor node will compute its location, if it knows the coordinates of A, B, C, and D.

20.6 Four sensor nodes and a base station placed on a 2D area form an ad hoc network
(Figure 20.14). These nodes will sense physical parameter and send them to a base
station, which will transmit the collected data to a remote laboratory. Assuming
Ed = K ⋅ d3, where Ed is the energy needed to send data at a distance d,
a. Determine the best location for placing the base station so that the energy spent
by all the nodes is as small as possible.
b. Identify the data transmission paths from the sensor nods to the base station.
20.7 Given a network G = (V, E), topology control generates a subgraph G′ = (V, E′), such
that (1) E′ ⊆ E, and (2) less energy is needed to route packets between a pair of nodes in
G′ (than in G). The XTC algorithm for topology control by Wattenhofer and Zollinger
[WZ04] has three steps: (1) Each node generates a ranking of its neighbors based on the
strength of the signals received from them. (2) Each node exchanges the ranking with its
neighbors. (3) Based on the information collected so far, nodes discard some of the links.
The strategy for including (or discarding) an edge is as follows: for a pair of nodes
u and v that are neighbors of node w in the original graph G, u ≺w v implies that
the signal strength from node u is weaker than the signal strength from node v as
perceived by node w.
Per XTC, node u will want node v as a neighbor (i.e., the signal strength is good)
if node v wants u as a neighbor. As an example, consider a subnetwork of four nodes
u, v, w, and x and their local rankings of the neighbors are shown in Figure 20.15.
Here, (v, x) is a preferred edge for both v and x since they locally rank each other at
the highest order. Then prove that
a. If (u → v) is a preferred edge for node u, then so is (v → u) for node v
b. The topology of the resulting graph is triangle-free
c. For disk graphs, the degree of each node is at most 6

20.8 In a sensor network, the battery of some highly active nodes can run out quickly
and cause a network partition. Assume that each node k has a variable R(k) that
records its residual battery power and each node can access the variable R(i) of every
neighbor i. To extend the life of the sensor network, nodes with low battery need to
go to sleep for a specific period of time.
Propose an algorithm using which a node can reroute traffic toward the
base station
before it goes to sleep. For scalability, the time complexity of the
rerouting algorithm must be low (preferably O(1)). Explain how your algorithm
will work.
20.9 Broadcasting of data is an important activity in sensor networks. A sensor initiates
the broadcast with a certain energy level Ed that is able to reach all nodes at distance
≤d and Ed = K ⋅ d2. The recipients forward these data via additional broadcasts, and
this process continues until all sensors receive the data. These operations form a
broadcast tree, where the initiator is the root and for every other node, the closest
sender sending the broadcast to it is the parent. The goal of the exercise is to complete
the broadcast using the minimum amount of energy.
In the sensor network of Figure 20.16, identify the minimum-energy broadcast
tree with the base station as the root. Assuming that the grid consists of
unit squares, and K = 1, compute the energy spent by all the nodes in completing
the broadcast.

20.10 Consider a simple averaging method for time synchronization in a wireless sensor
network. Assume that in each sensor node, the clock is counterdriven by a 1 MHz
clock (accuracy 1 in 104). Every 10 s, each node executes the following steps:
a. Locally broadcasts its own clock
b. Receives the broadcasts from its neighbors
c. Computes the average, discards the outliers, and resets its own clock
Assuming that the signal propagation delay is negligibly small and ignoring message
collision, estimate the expected accuracy of clock synchronization.
Programming Exercises
If you have a laboratory with working sensor nodes, then implement your solutions to the
following exercises. Otherwise, obtain a simulator that provides an authentic simulation
of sensor networks, and complete the exercises in the simulated environment. One such
simulator is TOSSIM. Here are some references that may be relevant:
1. http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos/ contains a tutorial on TinyOS.
2. http://www.tinyos.net/tinyos-1.x/doc/tython/manual.html describes Tython: a
Python-based scripting extension to TinyOS’s TOSSIM simulator.
You will need a few days to get ready with the required tools.
20.11 Multicasting on a Sensor Network
Implement multicasting on an 8 × 8 grid of sensor nodes using the gossip protocol.
Here is a description of a simple version of gossip(p):
A source sends the message to each neighbor with probability p. When a node
first receives the message, with probability p it forwards the message to each
neighbor. All duplicate requests are discarded.
Implement the protocol for various values of p. Draw a graph showing how long it
took for all the nodes to receive the message as a function of p. Simulate the protocol
on a large grid and study how many messages it took to complete the broadcast.
20.12 Localization Using Sensor Networks
The radio chips on the sensor nodes provide an RSSI value with each received message.
Using RSSI, determine the location of a given node within a floor/laboratory.
Assume that a set of fixed sensor nodes is mounted in accessible locations, and these
send out beacons at regular intervals. RSSI-based measurements generally do not
exhibit good accuracy—nevertheless, compare the accuracy of your measurement
with the actual location of the node.

Social and Peer-to-Peer
Networks
21.1 INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL NETWORKS
A social network depicts a social structure. It is commonly represented by a graph where
the nodes are entities, and edges denote a relationship between a pair of entities. Some
examples of entities are persons, organizations, various forms of living beings, web pages,
cities, and airports. When nodes represent people, an edge may denote a friendship relation
between them. When nodes are web pages, an edge from page x to page y may represent the
existence of a link from the former to the latter page. When nodes denote businesses, an
edge may denote the existence of a business relationship between two businesses. A social
network like Facebook® or Twitter® is a modern Internet-based platform to create a social
structure, and these have become extremely popular for communication and content sharing.
But social networks existed from the dawn of civilization. Beyond human society,
social network–like structures have been observed in many complex networks present in
nature, pointing to the existence of a science.
The mechanism behind the evolution of social structures has intrigued people for nearly a
century. Measurements conducted in various social networks have generated a large volume
of data, leading to important and sometimes surprising results. The theory of social networks
has evolved from such measurements, with the analysis of graphs as the primary tool.
21.1.1 Milgram’s Experiment
Historically, Milgram’s experiment [M67] triggered interest in the discovery of how
connected
social beings are. A measure of the connectedness between two randomly
chosen
individuals is the length of the shortest chain of acquaintances between them, often
referred to as the distance or the degree of separation between them. As an example, consider
Figure 21.1, where each node represents a person and an edge denotes that the nodes
at the two endpoints are friends. Thus, the distance between B and H is 4, and the distance
between E and C is 1.
466 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Milgram arranged to send 160 envelopes to a group of randomly selected people from
Wichita, Kansas, and Omaha, Nebraska and asked them to deliver the envelopes to a specific
target person. Each envelope contained the following:
1. A document with the logo of Harvard (Milgram’s home institution) on it.
2. The name, address, and occupation (stockbroker) of a friend of Milgram living in
Boston, MA. This person is the intended recipient of all the envelopes.
3. Instructions to get the package to the target person following specific rules where
each person could only send the package to an acquaintance. An acquaintance was
defined as being on first-name basis.
The initiator will send the letter to an appropriate acquaintance who will forward it to
the next one, until the letter reaches the target person. Milgram had a pressing concern
about whether any one of these letters would reach the target. However, after a couple of
modifications in the rules of package delivery, 42 of the 160 letters made it to the target
person via up to a dozen intermediate persons. The median value of the number of intermediaries
was 5.5, and the mean was 5.9, which can be rounded off to 6 leading to the
famous term six degrees of separation.
Milgram’s experiment had several limitations. Consider the following:
1. How did it account for the letters that did not reach the target person? Mathematically,
we should consider the number of intermediaries to be infinite, but considering the
imperfect nature of human beings, they were ignored.
2. The sample size was small—it was done on a small fraction of the residents of the
United States only. All packages were sent to only one target person in one city, and
these originated only from two cities.

Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 467
It would be fair to question if these results can be generalized to a population of much
larger size. Interestingly, recent experiments conducted on much larger sample sizes vindicated
the myth of six degrees of separation. For example, a 2007 study done by Karl
Bunyan on the Facebook platform with 5.8 million users showed that the average distance
separating two participants of the application is 5.73 with the maximum distance being
only 12.
These results are significant. It shows that human society is tightly knit, and there exists
a way for any person to reach any other person in the planet via a short chain of acquaintances.
Interestingly, small degrees of separation have been discovered in many other cases
too. In the following, we present some significant ones:
World Wide Web: The web can be represented by a directed graph for which each node
represents a web page, and an edge (i, j) indicates that there exists at least one pointer
from page i to j. In 1998, when the number of web pages was estimated to be 800 million,
Barabasi’s experiment led to the conclusion that the average separation between any two
web pages on the web is 19.
Film actor network: A film actor network is an undirected graph in which the nodes are
actors, and an edge between a pair of nodes indicates that the two actors acted together in
at least one film. Using the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) with a population of 225,226
actors, it was found that the mean distance between a pair of actors was only 3.65, and the
average degree per node is 61. The most connected actors were the hubs of the graph, with
Rod Steiger having the smallest distance of 2.53 from everyone else, Charlton Heston has a
slightly longer distance of 2.57, and Kevin Bacon’s distance is 2.79.
Electrical power grid: The electrical power grid of Western United States has been studied
as a social network, with the nodes as the generating stations and the edges as highvoltage
links connecting pairs of generating stations. This network has 4941 nodes, with
an average distance of only 18.7 between pairs of generating stations and an average
degree of 2.67 per node.
Caenorhabditis elegans: C. elegans is a simple worm of length 1.2 mm and lives in soil. It is
one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. Its nervous system consists of only
302 neurons, and the connections among these neurons have been completely mapped by
biologists, with the nodes being the neurons and the edges being synapses connecting a
pair of neurons.
21.2 METRICS OF SOCIAL NETWORKS
Many different metrics have been introduced to study the structural properties of a social
network. This section describes some of these metrics.
21.2.1 Clustering Coefficient
Consider the edges of a friendship network, where each node is a person and each undirected
edge between a pair of nodes i and j denotes the fact that i and j are friends with each
other. For any given node i of this graph, the clustering coefficient measures what fraction
468 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
of the various pairs of friends of node i are friends with each other. This is also the probability
that two randomly chosen friends of a given node i are friends with each other. In
Figure 21.1, consider B, who has four friends {A, C, D, E} from which six pairs can be constructed.
Of these, (A, D) are friends with each other and so are (D, E) and (E, C). So, the
clustering coefficient of B is 3/6 = 1/2. Note that the value of clustering coefficient always
ranges between 0 and 1. For a tree topology, the clustering coefficient of every node is 0,
whereas for a clique, the clustering coefficient of every node is 1. The clustering coefficient
values of the nodes of a graph intuitively reflect how close-knit the community is.
21.2.2 Diameter
Let d(i, j) denote the distance of the shortest path between a pair of nodes i and j. It is
also known as the geodesic distance. For all such pair of nodes, the largest value of d(i, j)
is known as the diameter of a social network. Thus, it is the largest degree of separation
between any pair of nodes.
21.3 MODELING SOCIAL NETWORKS
Given a number of isolated nodes representing actors, how does a social network evolve?
There are several models about the formation of social networks. Erdös and Renyi proposed
one of the earliest models based on random graphs. Their model is known as the
Erdös–Rényi model or the ER model.
21.3.1 Erdös–Rényi Model
The ER model starts with a set of n isolated nodes. Between each pair nodes, an edge is
added with a probability p. This results in the ER graph G(n, p). It represents the formation
of a social network as a random process. Note that the graph G(n, p) is different from
another kind of random graph known as G(n, m), which is a graph that is randomly chosen
from the set of all possible graphs with n nodes and m edges.
The connectivity of an ER graph G(n, p) undergoes interesting changes as the value
of p is increased. When p is much smaller than 1/n, the graph consists of a large number
of disjoint components—each component is a tree or a cycle of size O(logn). As
p reaches or exceeds 1/n, a giant component emerges—this is comparable to a phase
change in systems that evolve in the nature. The size of the giant component is O(n2/3),
whereas the smaller components still have a size O(logn). Finally, when p exceeds logn/n,
G(n, p) is almost always connected.
Some of the useful properties of the ER graph G(n, p) are summarized in the following:
Property 1: The expected degree of a node in G(n, p) is (n − 1) · p. This immediately follows
from the fact that a node chooses its neighbors from the pool of (n − 1) nodes with probability
p.
Property 2: The expected number of edges of G(n, p) is (n(n − 1)/2) ⋅ p. This follows from
the fact that there are

Property 3: The expected diameter of G(n, p) ≈ logkn, where k = (n − 1) ⋅ p, is the expected
degree of a node. It can be justified as follows: Let x be the diameter. Start a BFS from any
node, and the farthest ones must be at a distance ≤x. With degree k, the total number of
nodes within distance x must be ≤ 1 + k + k2 + k3 + ⋯ + kx.
Therefore, 1 + k + k2 + k3 + ⋯ + kx ≤ n.
So, x ≤ logkn.
Property 4: The expected value of the clustering coefficient of G(n, p) is p.
Property 5: The number of nodes N(k) with degree k in G(n, p) follows a binomial distribution

different ways of choosing k nodes from the
set of (n − 1) nodes. A binomial distribution is represented by a bell curve, which is one of the
signatures of a random graph.
The ER model of social networks held its ground for a long time but was later questioned.
There are some networks like the US highway network that fits closely with the random
network model, but most others do not. One of the characteristics of human society
is living in clusters—so any model used to represent such a social structure must have a
high clustering coefficient. However, the clustering coefficient of ER graphs is very small,
although on the positive side, the diameter is small. The quest for a better model for such
networks led Watts and Strogatz to propose the small-world model.
21.3.2 Small-World Model
In 1998, Watts and Strogatz reverse engineered Milgram’s observations and proposed a
model of social networks. The starting point is a regular clustered graph—specifically,
they started with a regular ring lattice of n nodes in which every node had a degree
k(n ≫ k > lnn)* as shown in Figure 21.2a. This graph has a high clustering coefficient, but
a high diameter too (≈n/2k). To minimize the diameter, they rewired the regular graph by
replacing the neighbors of each node by randomly chosen neighbors with a very low probability
p (Figure 21.2b). The regular links represented the local contacts and maintained
the clustered structure, whereas the randomly picked neighbors represented the occasional
long-range contacts. They demonstrated that when p ≃ 0.01, the resulting graph still has a
fairly large clustering coefficient, but the diameter substantially decreases, almost matching
the diameter of random graphs. These satisfy the requirement of the social networks of
human acquaintances. They called these small-world graphs.
Jon Kleinberg [K00] followed up with Watts and Strogatz’s small-world model and tried
to separate the issues of the existence of short chains among random peers and the discovery
of such short paths during an actual search. He argued that although Watts–Strogatz’s
* The condition k > ln n prevents the network from being partitioned.
470 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
construction of small-world graphs only proves the existence part, no decentralized algorithm
is able to discover the short paths between arbitrary pairs of nodes. He suggested a
modified construction of small-world graphs, which will facilitate the discovery of short
paths between pairs of nodes. Kleinberg’s model suggests that the long-distance neighbors
should not be chosen using uniform random probability, but with a skewed probability
distribution where the probability of choosing a node as a long-range neighbor decreases
with the distance of that node from the current node. He demonstrated that by carefully
defining the probability of choosing the long-distance neighbors, it is possible to route a
message to any other node in a very small number of hops, which explains the existence of
short hops between pairs of nodes.
Kleinberg demonstrated his construction on a 2D lattice. His construction has two parts:
1. Each node maintains local contacts with every node upto a lattice distance of p—this
reflects the local clustering of the nodes.
2. Each node randomly picks q long-range neighbors. Their addition involves a new
parameter r: the probability of choosing a long-range neighbor at a lattice distance d
is proportional to d−r.
Kleinberg showed that when r = 2, which is the dimension of the lattice, there exists an
algorithm using which each node can route a message in only O(log2n) hops. The algorithm
requires that in each step, the current message holder send the message to a node
that is as close to the target as possible.
21.3.3 Power-Law Graphs
While the small-world model is able to explain the presence of short path between pairs
of nodes, many real-life social networks do not fit into this model. Unstructured P2P

FIGURE 21.2 Watts–Strogatz construction of a sample small-world graph: (a) A regular ring lattice
with n nodes, each of degree k. (b) Each node replaces an existing neighbor by a randomly
chosen long-range neighbor (see the broken lines) with a very low probability p ≈ 0.1. The resulting
graph has a low diameter but a high clustering coefficient, which are the characteristics of a large
class of social networks.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 471
networks like Gnutella, US power grids, the WWW, and the US airport network all exhibit
a power-law distribution of node degrees. In a power-law distribution, the number of nodes
N(k) having degree k satisfies the condition N(k) = C · k−r, where C and r are constants. Such
networks are also known as scale-free networks. For a rich class of systems that evolve in
the nature, the condition 2 < r < 3 holds. Figure 21.3 compares the degree distributions of
a random ER graph and a power-law graph.
Barabási and Albert [BA99] described a method for generating a subclass of graphs that
satisfy the power-law distribution. Their method uses the concept of rich getting richer that
is also known as preferential attachment. The guiding principle is that when nodes join
an existing network, they are likely to connect to existing nodes that already have a high
degree, because such nodes are considered more influential and are likely to provide better
connectivity to the rest of the network. More precisely, if δ(i) is the current degree of
node i in the existing network, then the incoming node will connect to node i with a probability
proportional to δ(i). This means that the high-degree nodes are expected to attract
more neighbors than the low-degree nodes. We demonstrate here that this policy leads to
the creation of a power-law network.
Consider the creation of a network as follows: At time t = 1, a single node appears from
nowhere. Thereafter, at each time step, exactly one node is added to the existing network.
Let G = (V, E) denote the topology of the graph. A new node j can connect with an existing
network via m(m ≥ 1) edges. The probability that the new node j will connect to the existing
node i via edge (j, i) is C · δ(i) where C is a constant (Figure 21.4). As a simple case, consider
m = 1 (the resulting topology will be a tree). Since C i
i V
 =
  ( ) 1, (i) V
i V
=
  2 , and
at time t, |V| = t, it follows that C = 1/2t.
At time step t, let the number of nodes with degree k be n(k, t). At time step (t + 1),
a new node will join, which will modify the number of nodes with degree k. To compute
n(k, t + 1), observe the following:
1. If the incoming node connects to an existing node with degree (k − 1), then its degree
will increase to k. The probability of this event is (k−1)/2t.
2. If there is an existing node with degree k but the incoming node does not connect with
it, then its degree remains unchanged at k. The probability of this event is 1−(k/2t).
3. There is no other event that can influence the value of n(k, t + 1).

Let f(k,t) = n(k,t)/|V| denote the fraction of the total nodes with degree k at time t. Since

This leads to f(1) = 2/3, and (21.3) can be rewritten as f(k) = 4/k(k + 1)(k + 2). Therefore, after
a long period of addition of nodes, the network will stabilize to a topology for which the
fraction of its node with degree k will be of the order of 1/k3, and power-law distribution
will hold.
In power-law networks, short paths exist between arbitrary pairs of nodes—it becomes
feasible due to the presence of the hubs. Consider the US airport network again, which
is a power-law network. In traveling from one airport to another via a shortest path, in
how many occasions do we need to change plane more than two to three times? Another
important property of such networks is that they can tolerate the failure of random nodes
very well. Only targeted attacks on major hubs have the potential to cripple the network.
While these models help understand the structures of a large class of social networks,
the evolution of social structures may have many other mechanisms. One such mechanism
is to selectively adopt the neighbor of a neighbor as a neighbor forming triadic closures.
Another mechanism is to establish connections beyond local neighbors—this is possible
when actors meet based on common hobbies or travel in common transports like a bus or
a train or in a carpool. Both of these are mechanisms for growth in current Internet-based
social networks like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
21.4 CENTRALITY MEASURES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
Centrality is a measure of the importance of a node (or an edge) in a social network. There
are different aspects of centrality based on how you assess the importance. We present here
three forms of centrality measures.
21.4.1 Degree Centrality
The more neighbors a given node has, the greater is its influence. In human society, a
person with a large number of acquaintances is believed to be in a favorable position with
more opportunities. This leads to the idea of degree centrality, which refers to the degree of
a given node in the graph representing a social network. In Figure 21.1a, the degree centrality
of node E is 5 and that of G, H, I, and J are 3 each.
21.4.2 Closeness Centrality
The power or influence of a node can also come from its ability to act as a reference point
and by being a center of attention so that its influence is felt by a large number of nodes.
474 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Nodes that are able to reach other nodes via shorter paths, or that are more reachable by
other nodes via shorter paths, are in more favored positions. This structural advantage can
be translated into power, and it leads to the notion of closeness centrality. Consider the network
in Figure 21.1b, for which the table in Figure 21.1c lists the distances between the various
pairs of nodes. Let V denote the set of nodes, and for ∀i, j ∈ V, d(i, j) represent the
distance between i and j. A yardstick of the closeness of a node i from the other nodes is
d i j
j V
( , ).
  The smaller it is, the closer is node i to the other nodes. Closeness centrality
is sometimes expressed as a normalized value (ranging between 0 and 1) with respect
to the node that is the closest of all. In Figure 21.1b, it is node B and d B j
j V
( , ) =
  4 ,
and its closeness centrality is 1. For node E, d E j
j V
( , ) =
  5 , so its closeness centrality is
4/5 = 0.8. Similarly, for node A, d A j
j V
( , ) =
  6 , so its closeness centrality is 4/6 = 0.66.
21.4.3 Betweenness Centrality
Communication between nonneighboring nodes is channeled through intermediaries. For
each pair of nodes in a social network, consider one of the shortest paths—all nodes in this
path are intermediaries. The node that falls in the shortest paths between the maximum
number of such communications is a special node—it is a potential deal maker and is in a
special position since most other nodes have to channel their communications through it.
This leads to the notion of betweenness centrality.
To estimate the betweenness centrality of a node k, let V denote the set of nodes, N(i, j)
be the number of shortest paths between a pair of nodes i, j ∈ V, and Nk(i, j) be the number
of such shortest paths that include the node k. The fraction Nk(i, j)/N(i, j) is a normalized
measure of the betweenness centrality of node k with respect to the pair of nodes i, j.
Consider Figure 21.5. The shortest paths between the nodes A and G are ACEG and ABFG.
Therefore, the betweenness centrality of node C with respect to (A, G) is 0.5. The overall
betweenness centrality of a node is considered over all possible pairs of nodes in the network.
Here, none of the shortest paths among pairs of nodes in {B, D, E, G, H} includes node C,
but one of the two shortest paths between node {A, D} and {A, G} and the only shortest path
between {A, E} include node C. Assume that each source node pushes 1 unit of flow to a

destination node via shortest paths. In the presence of multiple shortest paths the flow is evenly
split, as node C will route (1 + 0.5 + 0.5), that is, 2 units of flow. The nodes that handle the largest
volume of flow have the highest betweenness centrality in the graph. The largest volume of
flow can be used to normalize the betweenness centrality of the other nodes in the network.
Betweenness centrality not only applies to nodes but also applies to edges. For a given
edge, it is defined in a similar way by counting how many shortest paths between various
pair of nodes include that edge and what fraction of the overall flows between pairs of
nodes is routed through that edge.
The computation of betweenness centrality involves examining the shortest paths
between every pair of node. There exist deterministic algorithms for community detection
with time complexity of O(m ⋅ d ⋅ logn) where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of
edges, and d is the depth of the dendrogram* [CNM04].
21.5 COMMUNITY DETECTION
Relations among entities within a social network usually have a significant amount of
heterogeneity. In many such networks, there is a higher concentration of edges between
a fraction
of the nodes that represent a community structure and a relatively lower
concentration
of edges between nodes belonging to different communities. The goal of
community detection is to analyze the graphs representing social networks and identify
such communities. Note that communities can also be divided into subcommunities—so
digging
into this hierarchy will end up in finer classifications. For example, within a social
network, the clients of a particular national store chain may form a community, and within
such a community, the senior citizens may form a subcommunity that is different from the
subcommunity formed by teenagers. In a given academic community, both biologists and
computer scientists are engaged in doing research and publishing research papers. Some
of these papers will be authored by only biologists, some will be authored by only computer
scientists, and perhaps only a smaller number of papers will have both biologists and
computer scientists as coauthors. Given an unlabeled coauthorship graph, a community
detection algorithm should be able to identify the existence of two distinct communities.
21.5.1 Girvan–Newman Algorithm
In 2002, Girvan and Newman [GN02] proposed an algorithm for community detection in
social networks. Given a graph G representing a social network, it identifies the edges connecting
distinct communities and removes them in an iterative manner, until the communities
were isolated. The edges connecting distinct communities are detected by measuring
their betweenness centrality. An outline of the algorithm follows:

do G is a single connected component →
Detect the edge(s) of highest betweenness centrality and
remove those edges
od
* A dendrogram is a tree representing a hierarchical clustered structure.
476 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
To detect the nested structure of the communities, the algorithm must run on each partition
until all edges are removed. The tree structure showing the communities and the subcommunities
in a social network is a dendrogram with the individual nodes at the leaves.
Since the time complexity of computing the betweenness centrality is substantial, it
may be tempting to avoid recalculation of the betweenness centrality of the remaining
edges after an edge is removed, but this will lead to serious error since the flows within the
graph adjust to the new topology. As an example, consider the graph in Figure 21.6. The
edge (4, 5) has the highest betweenness centrality of 5 × 5 = 25, since every shortest path
from any of the nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} to any other node in {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} must pass through
that edge. In contrast, the betweenness centrality of the edge (2, 3) is only 4, since one-third
of the shortest paths from anyone of {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} to 2 will pass through the edge (2, 3),
half of the shortest paths from any in {0, 1} to node 3 will pass through the edge (2, 3), and
the shortest path from node 3 to 2 will pass through (2, 3).* This also applies to the edge
(5, 8). Similar calculations will reveal that the betweenness centrality of the edge (3, 4) is
8.33. After the edge (4, 5) is removed, the graph is partitioned and the partitions expose the
community structures. Note that the betweenness centralities of the edges (2, 3) and (3, 4)
have changed after the removal of the edge (4, 5). The algorithm has a high time complexity—
it runs in O(n3) time on sparse graphs of size n = |V|, so is clearly not scalable.
A more recent algorithm by Raghavan et al. [RAK07] solves the problem in O( E ) time,
where E denotes the set of edges. It uses the concept of label propagation. The basic idea is as
follows: Initially, each node is assigned a unique label. Thereafter, at every step, each node
acquires the label that the majority of its neighbors currently have. Eventually, densely connected
groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label, and nodes with identical labels
identify a community.
21.6 INTRODUCTION TO PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKS
P2P networking is a paradigm where a set of user machines at the edge of the Internet
communicates with one another to share resources without the help of any central authority.
Geographical boundaries become irrelevant, and the absence of any central authority
promises spontaneous growth, as well as freedom from censorship. Peers include friends,

collaborators, and competitors, and the resource sharing has to be implemented through
decentralized protocols. Scalability is an integral part of this concept—no P2P system is
worth looking at unless it scales to millions of machines around the globe.
As an illustration, consider that you have several hundred movies in the digital format,
but not enough storage space in your computer to hold all of them. Some of your friends
might have surplus storage space in their computers, so they volunteer to help you with
storing some of your movies at their space. When these friends acquire new movies, they
also do the same thing, that is, use the storage space of their friends. In this way, a digital
library of movies is formed, which is distributed over a geographic region. Now, when you
want to access the movie Life of Pi, you would like to know where it is located. For this, you
apply a lookup function on the name of the movie (or use some other tool to map names
into locations), and the result gives you the location of the movie. You arrange to send
a request to that location through the shortest possible path and start downloading the
movie. The social networking giant Facebook uses P2P storage to build their Cassandra
file system that handles their Inbox search problem, the physical storage being scattered
around thousands of data centers around the globe.
P2P is one of the technologies that started with music sharing over the Internet and was
pioneered by Napster. A Napster client could download any MP3 music from another client
who has a copy of it. There could be multiple copies of the same song at different sites, and
a client could download the desired music from a next-door neighbor or from another host
halfway round the globe. After attaining significant popularity, Napster was closed by the
government for copyright infringement.
Regardless of these legal ramifications or ethical issues, P2P has led users to a new form
of freedom in collaborative resource sharing. For example, hundreds of small laboratories
in the world generating genomic data about newly discovered proteins now share one
another’s discoveries using P2P technology. Facebook and Twitter started using BitTorrent
technology for content distribution. This chapter presents the underlying principles behind
the various kinds of P2P networks.
21.7 FIRST-GENERATION P2P SYSTEMS
21.7.1 Napster
All P2P networks are overlay networks. An overlay network is built on top of an existing
network, where the set of nodes is a subset of the set of nodes of the original network, and
the edges correspond to paths between distinct nodes. Each node has an IP address, and
each edge can be traversed by one or more hops on the underlying IP network.
Current P2P systems are broadly classified into three different categories: centralized,
unstructured, and structured. The centralized architecture followed by Napster does not
strictly fit the profile of P2P systems since it used a central index server. However, Napster
has historic significance. Another early P2P system is Gnutella, which belongs to the
unstructured category: objects are located by flooding the queries. This section provides a
brief outline of these two well-known first-generation P2P systems. We will use the terms
songs and files interchangeably.
478 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
The old Napster had a centralized directory containing the indices of multiple files of
MP3 music stored at its clients’ machines. Each Napster client registers with the Napster
service and exports the names of the MP3 songs that reside locally on that host. Note that
Napster only stores the indices of the files but not the actual files. The directory may contain
the indices of multiple files with the same name. The server keeps track of all clients
currently connected to it. To locate a song, the user logs in and enters the title of the music
or name of the singer, which prompts the Napster utility to query the index server. If a
match is found, then a list of all matches is sent back to the client. The client can ping one
or more of these sites to estimate the download speed and then directly download the song
from one of these sites.
The new Napster is fully legal, and the company has changed its business model that
includes subscription service, as well as selling individual MP3 tracks and albums.
21.7.2 Gnutella
Gnutella started after the demise of the old Napster, and it used a fully distributed alternative
architecture. Unlike the old Napster, there is no central server that holds the indices of
all the songs that are available on the network of Gnutella clients.* Instead, these reside in
the clients’ machines. A new client must know the IP address of at least one other Gnutella
client. To facilitate the bootstrap operation, each client receives a list of the addresses of
working nodes. When a client P connects to an existing client Q, Q sends P its list of its
current neighbors. P will now try to connect not only to some of its own list of nodes but
also to one or more nodes from the list of nodes that it received from Q.
Once connections are established, queries for objects are propagated down the network.
The early search protocols used flooding—each client checks if the desired file is locally
available—if so, then the index and the IP address are made available to the originator of
the query. Otherwise, the query is forwarded to all other clients that it knows of. To guarantee
termination, each query is assigned a TTL, which reflects the maximum number of
levels that the query is allowed to propagate. Once this limit expires, the query is discarded.
The Gnutella protocol uses the following five descriptors:
Ping: Discovers hosts on the network by asking: Are you there?
Pong: This is the response to a ping, and it includes its IP address of the responder and the
amount of data that it wants to share.
Query: The primary mechanism for searching an object: I am looking for XYZ (the message
is forwarded until XYZ is located or the search is abandoned).
QueryHit: It is the response to a query in case a host has that object in its local store. The
descriptor with the IP address, port number, etc., required to download XYZ is propagated
to the client via the return path.
Get/Push: Initiate download. If the source is firewall protected, then the source gets a
request to push the object to the client.
* Since every client is also a server, Gnutella calls them servent (server + client).
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 479
One concern about the old Napster as well as the original Gnutella is their scalability.
For Gnutella, the flooding of the queries hogs network bandwidth. Even though the old
Gnutella kept some users happy at the scale at which it was operating, it certainly took
away useful bandwidth from other useful applications. Search traffic was taking a quarter
of the net bandwidth and users had limited visibility of what they could find.
As far as the old Napster was concerned, the centralized index server could have been
a possible bottleneck. But apparently, there was not much complaint about it since servers
were replicated. The claim was that there were 1.5 million simultaneous users at its peak,
and this demand was adequately handled via replication. To feel the pinch, Napster would
have had to cater to a much larger clientele, perhaps is debatable considering, but this is
how efficiently Google or Yahoo now provides service. Before these issues could be examined,
the government shut down the old Napster.
Another issue in P2P networks is their resistance to attacks and censorship. Did the old
Napster and Gnutella live up to that promise? Clearly, the old Napster did not! Once the
server sites were blocked, Napster became crippled. In contrast, Gnutella is a truly distributed
architecture—so blocking a small number of sites was not much of a disruption. To
disrupt Gnutella, one of the following two approaches* appears feasible:
1. Flood the network with bogus queries. This is not quite a DoS attack (as there is no
central server), but it can significantly slow down the sharing process and discourage
the clients.
2. Store bogus files or spams at many sites through malicious clients. The spam will
frustrate and possibly discourage the users from sharing.
21.8 SECOND-GENERATION P2P SYSTEMS
The lessons from old Napster and Gnutella led to the design of new breeds of P2P systems
that tried to overcome many of the limitations of the first-generation systems. There are
numerous candidates among the second-generation P2P systems. Prominent among them
are KaZaA, Chord, content-addressable network (CAN), Kademlia, Pastry, Tapestry, and
BitTorrent. Each of these systems addresses four primary issues central to P2P file sharing:
File placement: Where to publish the file to be shared by others?
File lookup and download: Given a named item, how to find or download it? How fast can
it be downloaded? Such downloads can be from the original server or from a proxy server
holding a cached copy.
Scalability: How is the performance affected when the network scales to millions of nodes?
No P2P network is worth looking at unless performance guarantees are provided at large
scales.
Self-organization: How does the network handle the join-and-leave operation of the clients?
The existing members should be made aware of the presence of the new nodes and
* We do not recommend any of these on an actual system!
480 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
the departure of those who left the system. Also, the new members must eventually know
about the existing members.
Additionally, some of the popular systems address a few secondary issues that make them
attractive to users. These are discussed in the following:
Censorship resistance: How does the network continue to offer its services in spite of potential
authoritarian measures that can shut down a fraction of the nodes? Such measures are
common in the face of differences in political or ideological views. One view of censorship
resistance is that even if a substantial fraction of the nodes is blocked, almost all the
remaining nodes should still be able to access almost all the original data items.
Anonymity: How to keep the name of the owner of an object or the location of its publication
secret?
Fault tolerance: How to prevent significant performance degradation in spite of node failures?
Free-rider elimination: A fraction of peers always uses resources (by downloading stuff from
others) but never contributes to the resources (uploading objects so that others can use). This
is ethically unfair. How can free riding be eliminated or at least free riders be discouraged?
Many of these issues are related. For the lookup problem, a central table as used in
Napster is not acceptable primarily from fault tolerance. A similar lookup is routinely done
by the DNS on the Internet. DNS has a hierarchical structure. The shutdown of a reasonable
fraction of nodes sufficiently high up in the hierarchy of DNS can be catastrophic.
Gia—an attempt to improve Gnutella’s performance: The Gia network by Chawathe et al.
[CRB+03] is an improvement over Gnutella in as much as it addresses the scalability problem.
Four proposals form the cornerstone of the improvement:
1. Gia replaces the flooding of Gnutella by random walk. One or more random walkers
can be engaged to locate the desired object. This lowers network congestion and
expedites object location.
2. Gia keeps track of the heterogeneity of the network by identifying which nodes have
higher capacity and bandwidth. Such nodes can handle a larger number of queries.
The principle of one-hop replication enables each node to maintain an index of the
content of its neighbors. Accordingly, high-degree nodes are likely to hold more clues
about the object being searched in their immediate neighborhood.
3. A dynamic topology adaptation protocol converts the high-capacity nodes into highdegree
nodes by encouraging them to adopt other nodes as neighbors. This helps
guide the search in a meaningful way—a biased version of random walk, where the
probability of directing a search to a node of degree δ is proportional to δ, helps the
queries gravitate toward high-degree nodes and improves the efficiency of the search.
4. Gia uses flow control tokens that are predistributed according to the capacities of the
nodes. Queries are not dropped but pushed to a node only when it is ready to accept
and handle it.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 481
The topology of Gnutella (or Gia) depends on when and where the peers joined the
network and does not strictly conform to predefined specifications. These are examples
of unstructured networks. In contrast, a class of P2P networks requires the peers
to store or publish objects following specific guidelines and maintain their neighborhood
in a predefined manner. Such networks provide uniform guarantees regarding
search latency and load balancing. These are called structured P2P networks and are
based on DHTs.
21.8.1 KaZaA
In 2001, the Dutch company Consumer Empowerment introduced KaZaA following the
demise of Napster. KaZaA improves upon the performance of Napster by using FastTrack
technology. A fraction of the client nodes that have powerful processors, fast network connections,
and more storage space are used as supernodes. The supernodes are spontaneously
designated, and they serve as temporary indexing servers for the slower clients. Since
the indexing service is no more centralized, KaZaA has much improved scalability and
fault resilience. A KaZaA client stores the IP address of a set of supernodes and picks one
of these supernodes as its upstream and uploads to it the indices of a list of files it intends
to share (with other peers). All search requests are directed to this supernode, which communicates
with other supernodes to locate the desired file. After the file is located, the
client directly downloads it from the peer. While the indexing servers retain the flavor of
Napster, the supernode–supernode communication used for forwarding queries is reminiscent
of Gnutella. KaZaA allows download from multiple sources and uses a lightweight
hash algorithm to checksum large files.
21.8.2 Chord
Searching files or objects in unstructured networks like Gnutella, in a way, amounts to
groping in the dark. Before initiating the search, the initiator of a query has no clue about
where the file might be located or if the file is at all present. This results in poor utilization
of the network bandwidth. Structured P2P networks use a hashing function to precisely
map objects to machines. This mapping function is used to publish and locate the object.
Accordingly, given the name of an object, every peer knows where it is available. As an
example, consider an m-cube. Assume that objects are stored into various machines located
at the n = 2m corners
of the cube, and given an object, the identity of the machine storing
that object can be looked up using a hashing function. This is the essence of DHT. To access
any object from a remote machine, the user will forward the query along the edges of the
m-cube. The propagation of both queries and replies will take up to m = log2n hops. To
make it possible, each machine will store the address of only m = log2n neighbors.
The earlier principle is the main idea behind Chord designed by Ian Stoica and his colleagues
[SML+02]. Each node in Chord maintains the IP addresses of a small number of
other nodes, called its neighbors or fingers. The physical adjacency of neighbors is not relevant.
A set of peers anywhere in the globe can form an overlay network, as long as their
routing tables clearly indicate how to reach one node from another either directly or via
other peers. Routing data from one peer to its neighbor is counted as one hop. Both node
482 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
identifiers and object names are mapped into the same key space 0.. n − 1, and the name-tokey
conversion is done using a consistent hashing function like SHA-1. Conceptually, Chord
maps the keys on the periphery of a circle, which defines the key space. Unless otherwise
mentioned, we will assume that the keys are mapped in the ascending order along the clockwise
direction of the circle (Figure 21.7). There may not be a physical machine for every key
position. An object with a key K is mapped to the machine with key successor(K)—where
successor(K) is the first node in the clockwise direction with key ≥K that corresponds to an
existing machine in the network. Consistent hashing [KLL+97] helps with load balancing
across different machines so that (1) every node stores roughly the same number of objects
with a high probability, and (2) when a new node joins or leaves the network, only O(1/n)
fraction of the keys are shuffled across machines.
Routing: Each node has a routing table (called a finger table) with m = log2 n entries. Each
entry is called a finger that points to a neighbor—the rth finger of the node with key K
points to the node with key successor(K + 2r−1 mod n). Figure 21.7 illustrates a Chord network
with keys 0–63. For the machine with key 8, its first two fingers will point to the
machine with key 12, since no physical machine maps to the keys 9, 10 or 11. If the first
finger of node i points to node j, then node j is the successor of node i, and node i is the
predecessor of node j.
Lookup: To look up an object, first generate its key K by hashing the object name.
Now follow a greedy search policy by taking the first hop using a finger that will lead
to a machine with a key closest to (but not exceeding) K. Repeat this step to route the
query until you reach the machine containing the desired object. With high probability,
each hop reduces the distance by at least half, so it takes O(logn) hops to complete the
lookup.

maps to the keys 9 and 10 represented by blank circles.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 483
Join and leave: Every P2P network is dynamic—from time to time, a fraction of the existing
nodes leave the network and new nodes join the network. The object placement rule
may be violated when an existing node leaves the network or a new node joins the network.
Accordingly, the leave and join protocols must restore the invariants by appropriately
modifying the fingers and moving the objects across the nodes. A consistent configuration
of the Chord ring satisfies the following two invariants:
1. For each node v, the successor and predecessor pointers are correct and satisfy the
condition predecessor(successor(v)) = v. The predecessor pointer helps check the integrity
of the current topology.
2. Each object with a key K is stored in successor(K).
We first illustrate the handling of the leave operation first. In Figure 21.7, assume that the
machine with key 50 plans to leave the network. For this, it has to offload the object(s) held
by it to another machine. After these objects are relocated to the machine with key 51, all
fingers
pointing to the machine with key 50 should be updated and redirected to the
machine with key 51. This concludes the leave operation.
For the join operation, each new node v will first contact an existing node v′. Node v′
will help the new node find its place in the Chord ring. The following three steps are needed
to restore consistency:
1. Node v′ will help node v find its successor node and initialize its finger table.
2. Node v will be added to the finger tables of the appropriate existing nodes.
3. Any object with key K such that successor(K) = v will be relocated to node v from its
current holder.
The time complexity of a join or leave operation is O(log2 n). The join and the leave protocols
of Chord are designed to handle one such event at a time. However, in practice,
the churn rate can be quite high, and the routing tables can become inconsistent when
multiple nodes concurrently join or leave. A stabilization protocol therefore periodically
runs at the background and restores consistency. The essence of the stabilization protocol
is for each node v to check if the invariant predecessor(successor(v)) = v holds. If it does not
hold, then stabilization protocol will modify some of the pointers and enforce this invariant.
As an example, let node v join the system, and assume that its id falls between two
nodes v1 and v2 (i.e., v1 < v < v2). Clearly, node v sets its successor to node v2, while the
predecessor of node v2 is still node v1. When the stabilization protocol runs, node v finds
out predecessor(successor(v)) = v1. So, node v sets its predecessor pointer to v1, contacts v1,
and asks it to set its successor pointer to v. Packets that are in transit while the network is
not stable may temporarily reach a wrong host. However, using the stabilization protocol,
each node restores its routing table. As a result, the subsequent hops will eventually lead
the packet to the correct machine.
484 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
Finally, nodes can occasionally crash instead of voluntarily leaving the system. This
causes objects with no backup to be permanently lost to the rest of the peers. To deal
with failure of a node, each machine keeps track of the IP addresses of the next r = 2 log n
nodes in the key space and replicates its objects in these nodes. If the probability of failure
is ≤50%, then with high probability, at least one of the replicas will survive and become
available to the users.
21.8.3 Content-Addressable Network
CAN is a structured P2P network developed by Ratnasamy et al. [RFH+01]. Unlike Chord
that uses a ring of keys to implement the DHT abstraction, CAN uses a d-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate space for the same purpose. For illustrating the basic architecture, we
will assume that d = 2. Objects are hashed into points in a 2D torus [0, 1] × [0, 1] as shown
in Figure 21.8. Each subspace of this 2D space is assigned to a physical machine, and this
machine hosts all the objects stored in its space. Initially, there is only one machine A that
will store all the objects. Later, when machine B joins the network, it contacts an existing
machine (in this case, it is A), which splits its own area into two halves and allocates one of
the two halves to B. All objects whose keys belong to the zone allocated to B will be transferred
to B from A, and the two machines become neighbors in the P2P network. Each join
is handled in the same way—an existing machine splits its own area into two halves and
gives one of them to the new machine. When a node leaves, its zone is taken over by one of
its neighbors. Sometimes, this leads to the creation of one larger zone. After a join or a leave
operation, the routing tables are appropriately updated. Nodes can also crash from time to
time, creating dead zones and causing fragmentation in the coordinate space. A node reassignment
algorithm running in the background merges some of the fragments into a valid
zone and assigns it to a nonfaulty node.

more nodes, E and D, join the network. The corresponding interconnection networks are shown in
the bottom row.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 485
The neighborhood relationship among machines is defined as follows: On a 2D plane,
any two machines whose regions share an edge are neighbors. In the d-dimensional space,
two machines are neighbors of each other, if their regions share a (d − 1)-dimensional
hyperplane. Figure 21.8 shows three stages of CAN. The routing table for each machine
has O(d) entries. Since d is a constant for a given implementation, the space requirement
is independent of the size of the network. Routing of queries takes place via the shortest
route from the source machine to the destination object. Figure 21.8c shows a sample
route from the machine E to an object in machine D. In a 2D space, the maximum routing
distance between a pair of nodes is n1/2—this holds when the interconnection network is
a square grid, and the source and the destination machines have coordinates (0, 0) and
(n1/2/2, n1/2/2). In general, in a d-dimensional torus, the routing distance between a pair of
nodes is O(d ⋅ n1/d) hops.
21.8.4 Pastry
Pastry, developed by Microsoft Research in 2001, is a substrate for a variety of P2P applications.
In addition to file sharing, such applications include global persistent storage utility
(PAST), group communication (SCRIBE), and cooperative web caching (SQUIRREL).
Pastry is a DHT-based P2P system. Each node is assigned a 128-bit id that is generated by
applying a cryptographic hash function on the node’s public key or its IP address. This id
defines the position of a node in a circular key space of 2128 nodes. In an n-node system, any
node can route messages to any other node in O(logrn) hops, where r = 2b (b > 0). A typical
value of b is 4. Compared to Chord or CAN, the hop count in Pastry is in general much
lower. In addition to routing with a low hop count, Pastry takes into account the physical
proximity between nodes during neighbor selection, which minimizes the electrical
distance between the source and the destination and leads to faster message delivery and
query processing.
Routing: Pastry routes messages using prefix routing. To implement prefix routing, each
Pastry node stores three types of information:
Leaf set L: Each node with id i maintains a list of L/2 nodes with numerically closest
larger ids and L/2 nodes numerically closest smaller ids. Typically, |L| = 2b.
Routing table R: Each node i has a routing table of size (2 1) b
− × log b n . 2 

Row j of the
table points to a node whose id shares the first j prefix digits with node i, but whose
(j + 1)th prefix digit is different from that of node i.
Neighborhood set M: This set contains the nodes that are nearest to i with respect to the
network distance (like round-trip delay).
A node can directly forward (i.e., in a single hop) a message to any member of its leaf
set. If the destination node is not in the leaf set, then the message is forwarded to a node
whose id shares the largest common prefix with the destination id. The routing table stores
information about such nodes. Thus, to route a message from X to Y, the source node X
486 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
first sends the message to a node P whose id has a larger number of prefix digits in common
with the id of the destination node Y. Thereafter, node P forwards the message to node Q
whose id has even more prefix digits in common with the key of the destination node Y.
This process is repeated until the final destination is reached (or a node in the leaf set of
the final destination is reached—it takes one more hop to reach the destination node). A
typical routing table for a network with n = 212 nodes and b = 2 (i.e., r = 4) is shown in
Figure 21.9a. It has logr n = 6 rows and (r − 1) = 3 columns. The symbol X denotes a wildcard
entry—thus, 21XXXX means some node whose id has the prefix is 21. Note that there is no
guarantee that such a node can be found, and therefore, some of the entries in the routing
tables are likely to remain blank. Figure 21.9b shows a possible route from node 203310
to node 130102. Define the distance between a pair of ids as the number of digit positions
where they differ. Then in each hop, this distance is reduced. The expected routing distance
between a pair of nodes is O(logn). In case a suitable intermediate node is not found in the
routing table, the message is forwarded to a node that shares a prefix with the key at least as
long as the local node and is numerically closer to the key than the present node’s id. Only
in rare cases, the final destination is not in the leaf set of the last node reached by prefix
routing (i.e., it is still more than one hop away but there is no suitable entry in the routing
table). If the distribution of the node ids is uniform, then with |L|/2 = 2b, the probability of
this event is less than 0.02. It becomes much lower when |L| = 2b+1. Should this happen, the
routing cost increases by one hop with high probability.
A larger value of b improves the efficacy of routing. When b = 4 (i.e., r = 16), and there
are a billion nodes, then between any two Pastry nodes, a message will be routed in at most
⌈log16 1,000,000,000⌉ = 7 hops. This assumes that the routing tables are fully populated.

Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 487
Routing performance marginally degrades when some entries in the routing table are
blank. Routing performance is also adversely affected by node failures. However, eventual
message delivery is guaranteed unless |L|/2 nodes with consecutive ids simultaneously fail.
Since the ids are randomly distributed in the key space, the possibility of this event, even
for a small value of L, is very low.
Finally, Pastry routing pays attention to locality by keeping track of the physical proximity
between nodes in a neighborhood set M. Physical proximity is estimated by the
round-trip delay of signals. A built-in function keeps track of this proximity. When a new
node joins, it updates the neighborhood sets of the nodes in its routing table. Using the
proximity relationship, each step routes the message to the nearest node with a longer prefix
match. Experiments have shown that the routing delay between a pair of nodes is only
60% higher than the routing delay in a completely connected network.
Pastry routing is inspired by the work due to Plaxton et al. [PRR99]—commonly referred
to Plaxton routing. In both cases, the routing is based on address prefixes, which can be
viewed as a generalization of hypercube routing.
21.9 KOORDE AND DE BRUIJN GRAPH
The quest for a graph topology with constant node degree and logarithmic diameter has
two answers in the P2P community: the butterfly network (used in Viceroy) and De Bruijn
graph (used in Koorde, the Dutch name for Chord). To explore the lower bound of the
diameter, we first prove the following theorem:

So, D + 1 ≥ logk(n(k − 1) + 1).
That is, D + 1 > ⌈logk n⌉.
Therefore, D > ⌈logk n⌉−1 ◼
The routing distance between the farthest pairs of nodes must at least be equal to the
diameter. Directed De Bruijn graphs come closest to this bound, sometimes known as
Moore bound. For n = 106 and k = 20, the diameter of De Bruijn graph is 5, when the
diameter of classic butterfly network is 8, and the diameter of unidirectional Chord
is 20. This led Kaashoek and Karger to propose Koorde. A De Bruijn graph with k = 2
can be generated as follows (Figure 21.10a): From every node i of a graph with n
nodes 0 through n − 1, draw two outgoing edges directed to the nodes i0 = 2 i mod n
488 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
and i1 = (2i + 1) mod n. Call these the 0-link and the 1-link of node i. A message from
node i to node j can be routed as follows:
• Shift the logn bits of j so that its leading r bits tally with the last r bits of i as shown in
Figure 21.10b.
• Forward the query along paths corresponding to the last (logn − r) bits of j: each 0 bit
will define a hop along the 0-link and each 1 bit will need a hop along the 1-link.
For k > 2, the earlier construction can easily be generalized. From each node i, there will be
k routing fingers pointing to the nodes k ⋅ i, k ⋅ i + 1, k ⋅ i + 2,…, k ⋅ i + k − 1 (additions mod n).
In spite of the promise, the use of De Bruijn graphs in P2P networking is very limited
so far. This is due to the problem of dealing with the dynamic environment involving node
join and leave operations. Each such operations will lead to changes in the routing tables of
every node across the network, which is not very practical.
21.10 SKIP GRAPH
Bill Pugh introduced a randomized data structure called skip list—its goal is to accelerate
the searching of objects in a sorted linked list by creating random bypass links.
Figure 21.11a shows an example to illustrate the main idea. There are eight nodes in the
linked list—all of them are all at level 0 (L0). Compare them to the stations in a subway
with a single line from left to right. From these nodes, randomly pick a subset (with 50%
probability)
and add them to a next level. The linked list at this level is the level 1 list (L1).
The links in level 1 are essentially bypass links, which are like express lines connecting
selected pairs of stations. Each list is fenced off by two special nodes +∞ and −∞ at the
right and the left ends, respectively. The construction is recursive—one can add a subset of

nodes from level 1 with 50% probability to another linked list in level 2 (L2). The construction
ends when there is a single node at the uppermost level.
Consider the example of searching objects in a skip list. Assuming each link to cost one
unit of time, a skip list can speed up search operations. At each level of the linked list, let
v.right and v.left denote the elements to the right and to the left of a node v. To search for
a node x, start with the leftmost node (v = −∞) at the highest level and follow these steps:
program search {search for node x in a skip list)
{initially v = ∝, level = max};
do v.right > x → move to the lower level
[] v.right < x → move to the right
[] v.right = x → node x is found
od
The search fails when the node is not found and no lower level exists.
A query for a node 65 will succeed as (L1)38 → 64 → L0(65), whereas a query for node 95
will fail as (L2)86 → (L1:L0)86 → 94 → ? In a standard linked list, the first search would
take six steps, and the second search would take nine steps.

FIGURE 21.11 (a) A skip list. (b) A skip graph—only three levels are shown. Under each node in
level 0, its membership vector is shown.
490 ◾ Distributed Systems: An Algorithmic Approach
One can use a bidirectional skip list (which uses a doubly linked list at every level) for
the efficient routing of messages between pairs of nodes. Such a route will try to make the
best use of the upper-level linked lists. For example, in Figure 21.11a, a query from 21 to 94
will be routed in four hops as (L0)21 → 38 → (L1)64 → 86 → (L0)94.
If each list is doubly linked, then the expected number of edges in a skip list with
n nodes is 2
2 4
n n 4
n n
+ + + += n . This means that the average degree per node is only 4,
a constant. Furthermore, the expected search latency is reduced from O(n) to O(logn), and
the expected routing latency is also reduced from O(n) to O(logn). These make skip list an
attractive data structure for large-scale applications.
Now consider using a skip list for query routing in P2P networks. Although routing
takes only O(logn) steps, a major problem occurs when multiple nodes start sending queries,
causing too much congestion at the top-level node. To balance the load, Aspnes and
Shah transformed the bidirectional skip list into a skip graph [AS03]. Figure 21.11b shows
a skip graph. Unlike skip lists, in a skip graph, every node has a presence in all the levels,
but they may join different doubly linked lists. From level 0, nodes that flip a coin get a 0
and join the 0-list in level 1, and the remaining nodes join the 1-list. The next higher level
further refines these lists and generates four lists for 00, 01, 10, 11 (some of which may
possibly be empty). The random bit string (resulting from successive coin flips) for a node
defines its membership vector. The construction stops when at the topmost level there are
lists of singleton nodes only. Essentially, a skip graph is a superposition of several skip lists
that share a common linked list at the base level 0.
The routing of a message from a source node to a destination node begins at the topmost
level using a greedy approach. When the next hop is likely to meet a dead end, or overshoot
the destination, the message is routed through the links at the next lower level in a recursive
manner. The lowest level linked list contains all the nodes—so message delivery to any
destination node is guaranteed if that node exists. However, by utilizing the upper-level
links as much as possible, routing latency is reduced. A summary of the performance of a
skip graph is presented without proof:
1. The expected number of routing hops between any pair of nodes in O(logn).
2. The expected number of links per node O(logn).
3. A node can join and leave the skip list in an expected number of O(logn) steps using
O(logn) messages.
4. The probability that a query from a source node i to a destination node j passes
through a node k at a distance d from j is at most 2/(d + 1). This inverse relationship
demonstrates good load balancing property—the presence of a hot spot affects its
immediate neighborhood only.
5. Skip graphs preserve the locality of objects and thus are excellent in resolving rangebased
queries. One can, for example, easily locate all the publications of Daily Iowan
during the period May 15–31, 2013. This is difficult in structured P2P networks like
Chord or Pastry where hashing destroys the locality.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 491
6. Skip graphs have excellent fault-tolerance properties. The expected search involves
only O(logn) nodes, and most searches succeed as long as the fraction of randomly
failing nodes is substantially less than 1/logn. A carefully targeted adversarial failure
of f nodes can disconnect up to O(f · logn) nodes from a skip graph. Clearly, for
random failures, the resilience is much better—experiments
have shown that most
of the large skip graphs remain connected even if up to 70% of the nodes undergo
random failure, and messages eventually reach their destination.
These properties show the promise of skip graphs for P2P applications. The details of
skip graphs can be found in Shah’s PhD thesis.
21.11 REPLICATION MANAGEMENT
Data replication reduces the access time and thus improves query processing in P2P
networks. Ideally, if everyone maintains a local copy of every data object, then sharing
will not be necessary—data will be instantly available and costly bandwidth will be
saved. But this drastically increases the space requirement of active processes. Efficient
replication strikes a balance between space and time complexities. Also, replication provides
fault tolerance—when some machines crash or are shut down, other machines
storing the replicas of the objects stored in the crashed machines maintain availability.
For writeable objects, replication leads to data consistency issues—we address here readonly
objects.
Replication can be proactive or reactive. The FastTrack protocol (used in KaZaA) supports
proactive or explicit replication (creates additional copies regardless of the demand
at a predetermined rate), and much of its success can be attributed to this policy. In
contrast, replication in Gnutella is implicit and reactive—all replicas are generated from
the results of previous queries. In [SC02], Shenker and Cohen investigated the issue of
explicit replication and its impact on the performance of query processing in unstructured
P2P networks. They formulated the problem as follows: Given an object, its search
size is the number of machines that will be visited to locate that object. The expected
search size (ESS) is the expected value of the search size for a set of objects and a set of
queries. This depends on a number of factors, like the number of replicas of the objects
available in the system, the location of the peers searching the object, number of queries
made for each object, and the search strategies (like flooding or random walk). The
important issue here is: given a set of objects, a search strategy, and a fixed amount total
space (we assume this to be 1 unit) available for storing all the replicas across the entire
system, how many replicas of each object should be generated so that the ESS is the smallest?
Note that excessive replication of one object will reduce the space available to the
replicas of the other objects.
Consider m objects 1, 2, 3, …, m, all of the same size, in an unstructured Gnutella-like
P2P system, where objects are searched using random walk. For a single object, the ESS is
inversely proportional to the scale of replication. With m distinct objects, let the normalized
query rate of object i be qi and the fraction of total space allocated to object i be pi. By

definition, pi

and qi
i
m =
=  1
1
. Without loss of generality, assume that q1 ≥ q2 ≥
q3 ≥ ⋯ ≥ qm. To minimize the ESS, two replication policies are quite intuitive:
• Uniform replication: Each object is allocated the same amount of space, regardless of
the query rate. Thus, ∀i:pi = 1/m.
• Proportional replication: The space allocated to the replicas of an object is proportional
to the query rate, that is, pi = qi. This makes sense because this is likely to lead
to faster access to the objects that are queried more often.
For insoluble queries, the search size is either equal to the size of the system or equal to the
maximum that is permitted by the TTL parameter of the system.
Cohen and Shenker [CS02] proved the surprising result that for soluble queries, the ESS
is identical for both of these replication policies. The optimal strategy is somewhere inbetween
uniform and square root replication. It is the new policy of square root replication,
where pi is proportional to qi .
In replication management, not only the number of copies but also their placement is
important. Apart from owner replication where the replication sites are determined by
the owner of the object, two other approaches are in use: path replication and random
replication.
Path replication creates replicas on all nodes in the path from the provider to
the requesting node. Interestingly, path replication spontaneously implements the square
root replication policy. Random replication, on the other hand, places replicas on a number
of randomly selected nodes in the search paths.
21.12 BITTORRENT AND FREE RIDING
BitTorrent is an efficient protocol for content distribution using the idea of file swarming.
The protocol is particularly attractive for distributing large files like video or movie files.
BitTorrent does not perform all the functions of a typical P2P system. The main idea in
BitTorrent is as follows: The file to be distributed is split into a large number of pieces and
a SHA-1 hash is appended for each piece. To allow sharing of the file or group of files, the
initiator first creates a .torrent file, a small file that contains the metadata about the files
to be shared, which includes (1) the length of the file, (2) piece size, (3) a mapping of the
pieces to files, (4) the SHA-1 hashes of all pieces, and (5) information about the tracker, a
computer that coordinates the file distribution. The tracker maintains the set of all peers
participating in the sharing of that file—this set is called a swarm. Each downloader first
accesses the .torrent file and then connects to the specified tracker that provides information
about other peers downloading the pieces of the same file. BitTorrent peers play two
different roles: seeders and leechers. A seeder is a peer that provides a complete copy of
the file. Initially, there is only one seeder, which is the peer that wants to distribute the
file. A leecher is a peer that downloads pieces of the file from other peers. As a leecher
downloads pieces of the file, replicas of the pieces are created. More downloads mean more
replica pieces are available in the swarm, and other peers that have not yet acquired these
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 493
pieces can download them. As soon as a leecher acquires a complete piece, it becomes a
seeder. Eventually, each leecher becomes a seeder by obtaining all the pieces and assembles
the file. The checksum associated with a piece is used to check the integrity of the piece.
The order in which the pieces are downloaded is critical for good performance. If an
inefficient policy is used, then peers may end up in a situation where each peer has all
identical set of easily available pieces and none of the missing ones. If the original seed
is prematurely taken down, then the file cannot be completely downloaded. Figure 21.12
shows the state of the peers in a swarm.
Two of the good policies for piece selection are (1) rarest first, so that a rare piece does not
become a bottleneck for completing the download, and (2) random first piece, at the beginning
of the downloading process—the eventual goal is to reduce the overlap among the
sets of downloaded pieces by the various peers, which expedites the download by opening
up more opportunities in piece selection and thus better progress. Near the end, missing
pieces are requested from every peer containing them. This ensures that a download is not
prevented from completion due to a single peer with a slow transfer rate. Some bandwidth
is wasted, but in practice, this is insignificant compared to its benefits.
According to an older study [AH00] on the Gnutella system, 70% of peers only
download files without uploading any, and 50% of the queries are served by only 1%
of the hosts. Users who only download but never upload any files are known as free
riders, or freeloaders. Freeloading is an inappropriate behavior that affects the healthy
functioning of P2P systems, and many solutions have been proposed and debated. An
apparent solution is to charge a fee and limit the time of downloads. Other approaches
include rewarding the donors by allowing them more downloads or faster downloads.
BitTorrent’s anti-freeloading
mechanism is based on the principle of reciprocation—
downloaders barter for fragments of a file by uploading some of the pieces that they
have already downloaded. This tit-for-tat mechanism discourages freeloaders. To cooperate,
peers must upload; otherwise, they will be choked. The system lets users discover

a set of more desirable peers who comply with this principle. It approximates Pareto
efficiency in game theory, in which pairs of counterparts see if they can improve their
lots together.
Using the BitTorrent protocol, Facebook is now able to send several hundred MB of code
updates to thousands of servers under a minute. The internal Facebook swarm treats every
server as a peer—this substantially accelerates the distribution of the new code. Twitter
also uses the same idea.
21.13 CENSORSHIP RESISTANCE, ANONYMITY
Most nations have a body that decides what information to censor and what information
to allow. What may be acceptable to one group of people may be offensive to another
group. Fiat and Saia [FS02] defined a censorship resistance network as one, where even if an
adversary (read censorship authority) deletes up to half of the nodes, (1 − ε) fraction of the
remaining nodes should still be able to access (1 − ε) fraction of all the data items, where ε
is a fixed error parameter. His solution for designing such networks involves modifying the
interconnection network of DHT-based systems using redundant links.
Freenet (launched in 2001) was designed to remove the possibility of any group imposing
their beliefs or values on any other group. The goal was to encourage tolerance to each
other’s values and freedom of speech (but not copyright infringements). Freenet preserves
anonymity using a complex protocol. Objects stored in the system are encrypted and replicated
across a large number of anonymous machines around the world, and their identities
continuously change. Each file is encrypted and broken up into several pieces. Not only
potential intruders but also the peers themselves have no clue about which peers are storing
one of their files or a fragment of it.
21.14 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The rapid proliferation of modern social networks has renewed interest in understanding
the mechanisms of growth and decay of these structures. With the membership of some of
the popular social networks reaching close to a billion, efficient analytical tools for these
networks are in high demand.
In P2P networks, structured or unstructured, which is better is a common debate. Both
have their strong and weak points. Unstructured networks need little management overhead,
although lookups are, in general, slower. On the other hand, in structured networks,
lookups are faster. However, objects need to be published following a stringent mapping
rule, and due to the high churn rate, the pointers as well as objects need to be constantly
moved to maintain consistency.
Since P2P networks are large-scale networks involving untrusted machines, various
security measures are important for serious applications. For example, a single malicious
node fielding multiple ids can disrupt the normal functioning of a P2P network. This is
called a Sybil attack. Another issue is resistance to spams. This will guarantee that users
are not fooled into retrieving fake copies of the object despite the malicious behavior of a
handful of machines.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 495
Uniform distribution of keys is important for load balancing in DHT-based networks.
The consistent hashing algorithm of Chord and Pastry takes care of this issue. Consistent
hashing guarantees that if there are k keys in a network with an id space of size n, then the
addition or deletion of a single node can lead to the reshuffling of at most k/n nodes with
high probability.
Chord does not take into consideration the geographic distribution of neighbors—thus,
a neighbor can be a machine in the next building or a machine halfway around the globe.
Since the routing time depends on the geographic distance, lookup will be faster if the geographic
location is taken into consideration while the neighborhood is defined. In contrast,
Pastry routes messages via geographically close neighbors. This expedites lookup. Finally,
the ability of handling high churn rate (the rate at which new nodes join and existing nodes
drop out) and the ability to deal with flashcrowd effect (sudden popularity of a file) may
play major roles in determining the usability of a given P2P system.
P2P networks have successful presence in the world of streaming data. Apart from the
distribution of videos through social networking sites, Skype is a proprietary P2P architecture
that powers our audio and video chats.
P2P networks are useful for building large amounts of storage. UC Berkeley’s Oceanstore
[KBC+00] and Facebook’s Cassandra file system [LM10] are two prominent examples.
However, in storage applications, cloud computing is a serious contender with its steeply
rising popularity. One needs to carefully weigh the pros and cons of these two technologies.
21.15 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES
Erdös and Rényi introduced the ER random graph model for a class of social networks.
Their eight papers that established the theory of random graphs are listed by Karonski and
Rucinski in [KR97]. Barabási and Albert [BA99] proposed the rich gets richer model for the
generation of power-law graphs. Milgram [M67] first observed the small-world phenomenon
in 1967. Later, Watts and Strogatz [WS98] presented a model of social networks
as a possible
explanation for the small-world phenomenon. Jon Kleinberg’s refinement of the Watts–
Strogatz model can be found in [K00].
Eighteen-year-old Shawn Fanning was the creator of Napster in 1999. The music industry
sued the company, claiming losses of millions in royalties. Napster lost the case in 2000
and ordered to be shut down. In 2002, Napster filed for bankruptcy. How the old Napster
worked is documented in [N02]. In 2011, Rhapsody acquired Napster.
Justin Frankel of Nullsoft, an AOL-owned company, developed Gnutella in 2001.
Currently, Gnutella Developer’s Forum is the sole group responsible for all Gnutella-related
protocols. The official documentation of Gnutella is available in [G02].
Soon after the shutdown of Napster, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis launched
KaZaA [K01]. Now KaZaA survives through some of its variations. DHT-based P2P
network Chord follows the work by Stoica et al. [SML+03]. Ratnasamy et al. wrote the
paper on CAN [RFH+01]. Pastry was proposed by Rowstron and Druschel [RD01]. John
Kubiatowicz led the Oceanstore project in Berkeley [KBC+00]—a brief summary of the
main goals of the project appears in their CACM article [K03].

Pugh invented skip lists [P90]. Gauri Shah’s PhD thesis contains the details of skip

P-grid project [ACD+03] describes a structured P2P network that provides good load balancing
in spite of arbitrary key distributions in the key space. Fiat and Saia [FS02] studied
how the DHT-based P2P networks can be modified for censorship resistance. Freenet
uses a different approach to censorship resistance and is based on the paper by Ian Clarke

degree k) of four networks. The scales are linear and approximate. Which one of
these four graphs possibly represents a power-law distribution (Figure 21.13)?
21.2 Consider three different network topologies with n nodes in each: (1) a ring topology
where each node k has a predecessor node (k − 1) mod n and a successor node (k + 1)
mod n, (2) a clique (a completely connected topology), and (3) an ER graph (where
with uniform probability p ≪ 1, an edge is added between each pair of nodes). Are
any of these acceptable as the topology of a P2P network? Why or why not? Briefly
justify your answer for each case.

21.5 DHT-based P2P networks aim at reducing the size of its local routing tables, as
well as the maximum number of hops needed to retrieve an object. Let us focus
on the architectures that use a constant size routing table per node and O(logn)
hops to retrieve any object. One such system is Koorde that uses De Bruijn graph
as the interconnection network. Another possibility is to use a butterfly network.
Explore the design of a P2P system that will use the butterfly network. You have
to address routing, as well as node join-and-leave protocols.
(Hint: See Viceroy [MNR02].)

21.7 Consider a 3D CAN with N nodes in it. What is the smallest size of the network,
beyond which the number of routing hops in CAN will be larger than that in Chord?
21.8 Caching is a well-studied mechanism for the improvement of lookup time in P2P
networks. Consider route caching that profiles the most recent accesses and stores
them in a local buffer. To the routing table of each node, add a buffer of size logn
to cache the IP address of the most frequently accessed objects by that node (call
them preferred objects), so that they are reachable in a single hop. We will call it a
selfish cache.
The selfish cache will shorten the routing distance in many cases. When a query
cannot reach its destination in a single hop, the original routing table entries will
be used to forward it. Assuming that the preferred objects are randomly distributed,
to what extent will the average routing distance be reduced compared to the
original Chord? Assume that the hot spots are randomly distributed around the
key space.
21.9 Experiments with access patterns in unstructured P2P networks have revealed clustering
effect, where each node’s communication is mostly limited to a small subset
of its peers. The identity of the nodes in each cluster depends on common interest,
race, nationality, or geographical proximity.
Assuming that such clusters can be easily identified through a continuous profiling
mechanism, explore how the clustering effect can be used to reduce the average
lookup time. (Hint: Use a two-level approach and speed up the common case.)
21.10 Concurrent join/leave operations or occasional transient failures can leave a Chord
network in a bad configuration. For the self-stabilization of such networks, local
checkability is an important requirement. Local checkability implies that for every
bad configuration, at least one node must be able to detect it by checking its immediate
neighborhood. Is Chord locally checkable?
21.11 Why is the geographic proximity of nodes an issue in routing queries on P2P
networks?
21.12 Why can a large number of BitTorrent clients download videos faster than what is
feasible in a client–server system or in the Gnutella network?
21.13 There are some strong similarities between search for domain names in DNS and
object search in P2P network. How is DNS currently implemented? Are there roadblocks
in implementing DNS using the P2P technology?
21.14 a. What kind of failures can partition the Chord P2P network? Are there remedies
to prevent this kind of partitioning?
b. What kind of failures can make objects inaccessible even if the network is not
partitioned? Are there remedies to prevent this problem?
21.15 When data are stored into unknown or untrusted machines, security of the data
becomes a key concern for serious applications. Describe all the methods that you
consider appropriate for safeguarding data in a P2P network.
Social and Peer-to-Peer Networks ◾ 499
21.16 Compare the advantages and disadvantages of storing persistent data in the cloud
versus storing data in a P2P network.
21.17 (Programming exercise) Download NetworkX, a Python package for the creation,
manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
This package has a library of various kinds of graphs as well as the implementation
of various useful algorithms for social network analysis.
Part 1: The goal of this homework is to generate a social network. Recall how a
power-law graph is generated using the idea of preferential attachment. Starting
with a single node, in each step, add a node to the network using a single edge.
The probability of choosing the node to which it will attach will be proportional
to the degree of that node.
a. Using this rule, generate three graphs, n = 1000, 2000, 5000 nodes.
b. Show the degree distribution of the generated graph: plot logN(k) versus log k,
where k is the degree of a node and N(k) is the number of nodes having degree k.
Verify that the power law (N(k) = c · k−r) holds, and estimate the value of r.
Part 2: Consider the Karate Club network described in http://haystack.csail.mit.
edu/blog/2010/07/12/data-by-the-people-for-the-people/.
Your tasks are as follows:
a. Compute the edge(s) of highest betweenness in this network.
b. Remove the edge(s) of highest betweenness, and visualize the graph and see
if it has been partitioned into disjoint communities. If not, then repeat the
earlier two steps, until the graph partitions, and then stop.
c. List the edges that you removed.
21.18 (Programming exercise) Study the construction of small-world graphs by Watts and
Strogatz. Then simulate a ring lattice with N = 5000 and k = 20 (the number of shortrange
neighbors). Compute the routing hops between fifty different pairs of peers
chosen at random. Explain your observations.
The code can be written in Java/C++. The Java standard library or C++ STL will
simplify life because you will have to use a lot of varying data structures to implement
the system. However, you are free to use a programming language of your
choice.
21.19 (Programming project) Use a web crawler to explore the topology of the web of your
institution and check if it satisfies the power-law distribution.

Preface
This textbook is meant for a course on distributed algorithms for senior-level undergraduate
or graduate students in computer science or software engineering, and as
a quick reference for researchers in the field. It focuses on fundamental algorithms
and results in distributed computing. The distributed algorithms treated in this book
are largely “classics” that were selected mainly because they are instructive with regard
to the algorithmic design of distributed systems or shed light on key issues in
distributed computing and concurrent programming.
The book consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to message-passing communication.
It evolved from a course at the VU University Amsterdam, which was
originally based on the textbook Introduction to Distributed Algorithms by Gerard
Tel. The second part is devoted to shared-memory architectures.
There are two very different ways to structure an algorithms course. One way
is to discuss algorithms and their analysis in great detail. The advantage of this approach
is that students may gain deep insight into the algorithms and at the same
time experience in mathematical reasoning on their correctness and performance.
Another way is to discuss algorithms and their correctness in an informal manner,
and let students get acquainted with an algorithm from different angles by means of
examples and exercises, without a need to understand the intricacies of the respective
model and its underlying assumptions. Mathematical argumentations, which can be
a stumbling block for many students, are thus avoided. An additional advantage is
that a large number of algorithms can be discussed within a relatively short time,
providing students with many different views on and solutions to challenges in distributed
computing. In ten years of teaching distributed algorithms I have converged
to the latter approach, most of all because the students in my lectures tend to have
hands-on experience and practical interests with regard to distributed systems. As a
result, the learning objective of my course has been algorithmic thought rather than
proofs and logic.
This book provides a Cook’s tour of distributed algorithms. This phrase, meaning
a rapid but extensive survey, refers to Thomas Cook, the visionary tour operator (and
not the great explorer James Cook). Accordingly, this book intends to be a travel
guide through the world of distributed algorithms. A notable difference from other
x Preface
books in this area is that it does not emphasize correctness proofs. Algorithms are
explained by means of brief informal descriptions, illuminating examples and exercises.
The exercises have been carefully selected to make students well-acquainted
with the intricacies of distributed algorithms. Proof sketches, arguing the correctness
of an algorithm or explaining the idea behind a fundamental result, are presented at
a rather superficial level.
A thorough correctness proof, of course, is important in order to understand an
algorithm in full detail. My research area is automated correctness proofs of distributed
algorithms and communication protocols; I wrote two textbooks devoted
to this topic. In the current textbook, however, intuition prevails. I recommend that
readers who want to get a more detailed description of a distributed algorithm in
this book consult the original paper, mentioned in the bibliographical notes at the
end of each chapter. Moreover, pseudocode descriptions of a considerable number of
algorithms are provided as an appendix.
I gratefully acknowledge the support of Helle Hvid Hansen, Jeroen Ketema, and
David van Moolenbroek with providing detailed solutions to the exercises in this
book, and the comments by students on early versions of these lecture notes, in particular
from Tessel Bogaard, Istv´an Haller, Jan van der Lugt, and Armando Miraglia.
Special thanks go to Gerard Tel for his useful feedback over the years.

Introduction
In this age of the Internet, wide and local area networks, and multicore laptops, the
importance of distributed computing is crystal clear. The fact that you have opened
this book means that no further explanation is needed to convince you of this point.
The majority of modern-day system designers, system programmers, and ICT support
staff must have a good understanding of concurrent programming. This, however,
is easier said than done.
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a particular problem on a computer.
To become a skilled programmer, it is essential to have good insight into algorithms.
Every computer science degree program offers one or more courses on basic
algorithms, typically for searching and sorting, pattern recognition, and finding shortest
paths in graphs. There, students learn how to detect such subproblems within their
computer programs and solve them effectively. Moreover, they are trained to think algorithmically,
to reason about the correctness of algorithms, and to perform a simple
complexity analysis.
Distributed computing is very different from and considerably more complex
than a uniprocessor setting, because executions at the nodes in a distributed system
are interleaved. When two nodes can concurrently perform events, it cannot be predicted
which of the events will happen first in time. This gives rise, for instance, to
so-called race conditions; if two messages are traveling to the same node in the network,
different behavior may occur depending on which of the messages reaches its
destination first. Distributed systems are therefore inherently nondeterministic: running
a system twice from the same initial configuration may yield different results.
And the number of reachable configurations of a distributed system tends to grow
exponentially with respect to its number of nodes.
Another important distinction between distributed and uniprocessor computing
is the fact that the nodes in a distributed system in general do not have up-to-date
knowledge of the global state of the system. They are aware of their own local states,
but not always of the local states at other nodes or of the messages in transit. For example,
termination detection becomes an issue. It must be determined that all nodes
in the system have terminated; and even if this is the case, there may still be a message
in transit that will make the receiving node active again.
2 1 Introduction
This book offers a wide range of basic algorithms for key challenges in distributed
systems, such as termination detection, or letting the nodes in a distributed
network together build a snapshot of a global system state. The main aim is to provide
students with an algorithmic frame of mind so that they can recognize and solve
fundamental problems in distributed computing. They are offered a bird’s-eye view
on such problems from many different angles, as well as handwaving correctness
arguments and back-of-the-envelope complexity calculations.
The two main communication paradigms for distributed systems are message
passing, in which nodes send messages to each other via channels, and shared memory,
in which different execution threads can read and write to the same memory
locations. This book is split into two parts, dedicated to these two communication
paradigms. The remainder of this chapter presents some preliminaries that are applicable
to both frameworks.
Sets
As usual, S1 ∪ S2, S1\S1 and S1 ⊆ S2 denote set union, difference and inclusion;
s ∈ S means that s is an element of the set S. The sets of natural and real numbers
are denoted with N and R. The Booleans consist of the elements true and false.
A set may be written as {· · · | · · · }, where to the left of | the elements in the set
are described, and to the right the property that they should satisfy is identified. For
example, {n ∈ N | n > 5} represents the set of natural numbers greater than 5. The
empty set is denoted by ∅. For any finite set S, |S| denotes its number of elements.
Complexity measures
Complexity measures state how resource consumption (messages, time, space) grows
in relation to input size. For example, if an algorithm has a worst-case message complexity
of O(n2), then for an input of size n, the algorithm in the worst case takes in
the order of n2 messages, give or take a constant.
Let f, g : N → R>0, meaning that the functions f and g map natural numbers
to positive real numbers. We write f = O(g) if f is bounded from above by g,
multiplied with some positive constant:
f = O(g) if, for someC > 0, f(n) ≤ C·g(n) for all n ∈ N.
Likewise, f = Ω(g) means that f is bounded by g from below, multiplied with some
positive constant:
f = Ω(g) if, for someC > 0, f(n) ≥ C·g(n) for all n ∈ N.
Finally, f = Θ(g) means that f is bounded by g from above as well as below:
f = Θ(g) if f = O(g) and f = Ω(g).
So if an algorithm has, say, a worst-case message complexity of Θ(n2), then this
upper bound is sharp.
1 Introduction 3
Example 1.1 Let a, b > 0 be constants.
– na = O(nb) if a ≤ b.
– na = O(bn) if b > 1.
– loga n = O(nb) for all a, b.
Divide-and-conquer algorithms, which recursively divide a problem into smaller
subproblems until they are simple enough to be solved directly, typically have a
logarithm in their time complexity. The reason is that dividing a problem of input
size 2k into subproblems of size 1 takes k steps, and k = log2 2k.
One can write O(log n) instead of O(loga n). Namely, by definition, loga an =
n, which implies aloga n = n. So
aloga b· logb n = blogb n = n.
Therefore, loga b· logb n = loga n. So logb n = O(loga n) for all a, b > 0.
Complexity measures will sometimes use the notations ⌊a⌋ and ⌈a⌉, meaning
the largest integer k such that k ≤ a, and the smallest integer ℓ such that ℓ ≥ a,
respectively.
Resource consumption of an execution of a distributed algorithm can be measured
in several ways.
• Message complexity: the total number of messages exchanged.
• Bit complexity: the total number of bits exchanged.
• Time complexity: the amount of time required to complete the execution.
• Space complexity: the total amount of space needed for the processes.
Part I, on the message-passing framework, focuses mostly on message complexity.
Bit complexity is interesting only when messages can be very long. In the analysis of
time complexity we assume that event processing takes no time, and that a message
is received at most one time unit after it is sent.
Different executions may give rise to different consumption of resources. We
consider worst- and average-case complexity, the latter with some probability distribution
over all executions.
Orders
A (strict) order on a set S is a binary relation between elements of S that is irreflexive,
asymmetric and transitive, meaning that for all a, b, c ∈ S: a < a does not hold; if
a < b then b < a does not hold; and if a < b and b < c then a < c. An order is total
if for any distinct a, b ∈ S either a < b or b < a; otherwise the order is called partial.
Given two sets S1 and S2 with orders <1 and <2, respectively, the lexicographical
order < on pairs from S1 × S2 is defined by (a1, a2) < (b1, b2) if either a1 <1 b1,
or a1 = b1 and a2 <2 b2. If <1 and <2 are total orders, then so is the corresponding
lexicographical order <.
4 1 Introduction
Modulo arithmetic
The integer domain modulo a positive natural number n is represented by the elements
{0, . . . , n − 1}. Each integer k has a representative modulo n, denoted
by k mod n, being the unique ℓ ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} such that k − ℓ is divisible
by n. This means that integer values are wrapped around when they reach n:
n mod n is represented by 0, (n + 1) mod n by 1, and so on. Addition and multiplication
on integers carry over to modulo arithmetic in a straightforward fashion:
(j mod n) + (k mod n) = (j + k) mod n and (j mod n) · (k mod n) =
(j · k) mod n.

Message Passing

Preliminaries
In a message-passing framework, a distributed system consists of a finite network (or
graph) of N processes (or nodes). Each process in the network carries a unique ID.
The processes in the network are connected by channels (or edges), through which
they can send messages to each other. There is at most one channel from one process
to another, and a process does not have a channel to itself. Sometimes a process may
want to communicate a message to itself, but for this clearly no channel is needed.
We use E and D to denote the number of channels and the diameter of the network,
respectively.
A process can record its own state and the messages it sends and receives; processes
do not share memory or a global clock. Each process knows only its (direct)
neighbors in the network. The topology of the network is assumed to be strongly
connected, meaning that there is a path from each process to every other process.
Communication in the network is asynchronous, meaning that sending and receiving
a message are distinct events at the sending and receiving process, respectively.
The delay of a message in a channel is arbitrary but finite. We assume that
communication protocols are being used to avoid that messages are garbled, duplicated
or lost. Channels need not be FIFO, meaning that messages can overtake each
other.
In a directed network, messages can travel only in one direction through a channel,
while in an undirected network, messages can travel either way. Undirected
channels are required for distributed algorithms that use an acknowledgment scheme.
Acyclic networks will always be undirected, since otherwise the network would not
be strongly connected. A network topology is called complete if there is an undirected
channel between each pair of different processes.
A spanning tree of an undirected network is a connected, acyclic graph that consists
of all the nodes and a subset of the edges in the network. The edges of the
spanning tree are called tree edges, and all other edges are called frond edges. Often
the edges in a spanning tree are given a direction to obtain a sink tree, in which all
paths lead to the same node, called the root; each directed edge leads from a child to
its parent.
8 2 Preliminaries
At some places we will deviate from the assumptions mentioned so far and move
to, for instance, synchronous communication in which sending and receiving of the
same message form one atomic event, or unreliable processes or channels, or FIFO
channels, or processes without a unique ID, or processes with a probabilistic instead
of a deterministic specification. This will then be stated explicitly.
Transition systems
A distributed algorithm, which runs on a distributed system, provides (usually deterministic)
specifications for the individual processes. The global state of a distributed
algorithm, called a configuration, evolves by means of transitions. The overall behavior
of a distributed system is captured by a transition system, which consists of:
• a set C of configurations,
• a binary transition relation→on C, and
• a set I ⊆ C of initial configurations.
A configuration γ is terminal if it has no outgoing transition: γ → δ for no δ ∈ C.
An execution of the distributed system is a sequence γ0 γ1 γ2 · · · of configurations
that is either infinite or ends in a terminal configuration γk, such that:
• γ0 ∈ I, and
• γi → γi+1 for all i ≥ 0 (and in case of a finite execution, i < k).
A configuration δ is reachable if there is a γ0 ∈ I and a sequence γ0 γ1 · · · γk with
γi → γi+1 for all 0 ≤ i < k and γk = δ.
States and events
The configuration of a distributed system is composed from the local states of its
processes and the messages in transit. A transition between configurations of a distributed
system is associated to an event (or, in case of synchronous communication,
two events) at one (or two) of its processes. A process can perform internal, send and
receive events. An internal event influences only the state at the process where the
event is performed. Typical internal events are reading or writing to a local variable.
Assignment of a new value to a variable is written as ←; for example, n ← n + 1
means that the value of variable n, representing a natural number, is increased by
one. A send event in principle gives rise to a corresponding receive event of the same
message at another process. It is assumed that two different events never happen at
the same moment in real time (with the exception of synchronous communication).
A process is an initiator if its first event is an internal or send event; that is, an
initiator can start performing events without input from another process. An algorithm
is centralized if there is exactly one initiator. A decentralized algorithm can
have multiple initiators.
2 Preliminaries 9
Assertions
An assertion is a predicate on the configurations of an algorithm. That is, in each
configuration the assertion is either true or false.
An assertion is a safety property if it is true in each reachable configuration of
the algorithm. A safety property typically expresses that something bad will never
happen. Examples of safety properties are:
– You can always count on me.
– The cost of living never decreases.
– If an interrupt occurs, a message will be printed within one second.
In particular, the last example states that never no message gets printed within one
second after an interrupt.
In general, it is undecidable whether a given configuration is reachable. An assertion
P is an invariant if:
• P(γ) for all γ ∈ I, and
• if γ → δ and P(γ), then P(δ).
In other words, an invariant is true in all initial configurations and is preserved by all
transitions. Clearly, each invariant is a safety property. Note that checking whether
an assertion is an invariant does not involve reachability.
An assertion is a liveness property if executions, from some point on, contain a
configuration in which the assertion holds. A liveness property typically expresses
that something good will eventually happen. Examples of liveness properties are:
– What goes up, must come down.
– The program always eventually terminates.
– If an interrupt occurs, a message will be printed.
A liveness property sometimes holds only with respect to the so-called fair executions
of an algorithm. For example, consider a simple algorithm that consists of
flipping a coin until the result is tails. Since there is an infinite execution in which the
outcome of every coin flip is heads, the liveness property that eventually the outcome
will be tails does not hold. However, if the coin is fair, this infinite execution has zero
chance of happening; infinitely often we flip the coin with the possible outcome tails,
but never is the outcome tails. We say that an execution is fair if every event that can
happen in infinitely many configurations in the execution is performed infinitely often
during the execution. The infinite execution in which the outcome of every coin
flip is heads is not fair. Note that any finite execution is by default fair.
Causal order
In each configuration of an asynchronous distributed system, events that can occur
at different processes are independent, meaning that they can happen in any order.
The causal order ≺ is a binary relation on events in an execution such that a ≺ b
if and only if a must happen before b. That is, the events in the execution cannot be
reordered in such a way that a happens after b. The causal order for an execution is
the smallest relation such that:
10 2 Preliminaries
• if a and b are events at the same process and a occurs before b, then a ≺ b,
• if a is a send and b the corresponding receive event, then a ≺ b, and
• if a ≺ b and b ≺ c, then a ≺ c.
We write a ≼ b if either a ≺ b or a = b. Distinct events in an execution that are not
causally related are called concurrent. An important challenge in the design of distributed
systems is to cope with concurrency (for example, to avoid race conditions).
A permutation of concurrent events in an execution does not affect the result of
the execution. These permutations together form a computation. All executions of a
computation start in the same configuration, and if they are finite, they all end in the
same terminal configuration. In general, we will consider computations rather than
executions.
Logical clocks
A common physical clock, which tries to approximate the global real time, is in
general difficult to maintain by the separate processes in a distributed system. For
many applications, however, we are not interested in the precise moments in time at
which events occur, but only in the ordering of these occurrences in time. A logical
clock C maps occurrences of events in a computation to a partially ordered set such
that
a ≺ b ⇒ C(a) < C(b).
Lamport’s clock LC assigns to each event a the length k of a longest causality chain
a1 ≺ · · · ≺ ak = a in the computation. It is not hard to see that a ≺ b implies
LC(a) < LC(b), so Lamport’s clock is a logical clock. The clock values that Lamport’s
clock assigns to events can be computed at run-time as follows. Consider an
event a, and let k be the clock value of the previous event at the same process (k = 0
if there is no such previous event).
• If a is an internal or send event, then LC(a) = k + 1.
• If a is a receive event and b the send event corresponding to a, then LC(a) =
max{k, LC(b)} + 1.
Lamport’s clock may order concurrent events; that is, it may be the case that
LC(a) < LC(b) for concurrent events a and b. Sometimes it is useful to use a
logical clock for which this is never the case. The vector clock VC has the property
that
a ≺ b ⇔ VC(a) < VC(b).
Let the network consist of processes p0, . . . , pN−1. The vector clock assigns to
events in a computation values in NN, whereby this set is provided with a partial
order defined by:
(k0, . . . , kN−1) ≤ (ℓ0, . . . , ℓN−1) ⇔ ki ≤ ℓi for all i = 0, . . . , N − 1.
(In contrast to the lexicographical order on NN, this order is partial.) The vector
clock is defined as follows: VC(a) = (k0, . . . , kN−1) where each ki is the length
Exercises 11
of a longest causality chain ai
1 ≺ · · · ≺ ai
ki of events at process pi with ai
ki ≼ a.
Clearly, a ≺ b implies VC(a) < VC(b); this follows from the fact that c ≼ a
implies c ≺ b, for each event c. Conversely, VC(a) < VC(b) implies a ≺ b.
Namely, consider the longest causality chain ai
1 ≺ · · · ≺ ai
k = a of events at the
process pi where a occurs. Then VC(a) < VC(b) implies that the i-th coefficient
of VC(b) is at least k, and so a ≼ b. Since clearly a and b must be distinct events,
a ≺ b. The vector clock can also be computed at run-time (see exercise 2.7).
Basic and control algorithms
Several chapters will discuss distributed algorithms to provide some service or detect
a certain property during the execution of a distributed algorithm. For instance,
chapter 3 shows how processes can take a snapshot of a configuration in the ongoing
computation, chapter 6 treats how processes can detect termination, and chapter 7
discusses garbage collection to reclaim unaccessible objects in memory. Then the
underlying distributed algorithm for which we are taking a snapshot, detecting termination
or collecting garbage, is called the basic algorithm, while the distributed
algorithm put on top for executing this specific task is called the control algorithm.
Bibliographical notes
Lamport’s clock originates from [45]. The vector clock was proposed independently
in [29] and [55]. Dedicated frameworks exist to support the implementation of distributed
algorithms on graphs [53, 41].

Snapshots
A snapshot of an execution of a distributed algorithm is a configuration of this execution,
consisting of the local states of the processes and the messages in transit.
Snapshots are useful to try to determine offline properties that will remain true as
soon as they have become true, such as deadlock (see chapter 5), termination (see
chapter 6) or garbage (see chapter 7). Moreover, snapshots can be used for checkpointing
to restart after a failure, or for debugging.
In a centralized environment one can at any moment during a program run query
the program state, consisting of the values of the program variables. In a distributed
setting, this is not the case. Suppose that a process that is involved in the execution of
a distributed algorithm wants to make a snapshot of a configuration of the ongoing
execution. Then it should ask all processes to take a snapshot of their local state.
Processes moreover have to compute channel states, of messages that were in transit
at the moment of the snapshot. The challenge is to develop a snapshot algorithm
that works at run-time, that is, without freezing the execution of the basic algorithm
of which the snapshot is taken. Messages of the basic algorithm are called basic
messages, while messages of the snapshot algorithm are called control messages.
A complication is that processes take local snapshots and compute channel states
at different moments in time. Therefore, a snapshot may actually not represent a
configuration of the ongoing execution, but a configuration of an execution in the
same computation is good enough. Such a snapshot is called consistent.
One has to be careful not to take an inconsistent snapshot. For instance, a process
p could take a local snapshot and then send a basic message m to a process q, where
q could either take a local snapshot after the receipt of m or include m in the state
of the channel pq. This would turn m into a “ghost” message of the snapshot, which
was not sent according to p but was in transit or received according to q. Likewise, p
could send a basic message m before taking its local snapshot, while q could receive
m after taking its local snapshot and exclude m from the channel state of pq. Such
incorrect snapshots clearly have to be avoided.
An event is called presnapshot if it occurs at a process before the local snapshot
at this process is taken; else it is called postsnapshot. A snapshot is consistent
if: (1) for each presnapshot event a, all events that are causally before a are also
14 3 Snapshots
presnapshot; and (2) a basic message is included in a channel state if and only if
the corresponding send event is presnapshot while the corresponding receive event is
postsnapshot. The first property guarantees that all presnapshot events can be placed
before the postsnapshot events in the actual execution by means of permutations that
do not violate the causal order. This implies that the snapshot is a configuration of an
execution that is in the same computation as the actual execution.
We discuss two decentralized snapshot algorithms for directed networks; the
first one requires channels to be FIFO. In these algorithms, the individual processes
record fragments of the snapshot; the subsequent phase of collecting these fragments
to obtain a composite view is omitted here.
3.1 Chandy-Lamport algorithm
The Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm requires that channels are FIFO. Any initiator
can decide to take a local snapshot of its state. It then sends a control message
⟨marker⟩ through all its outgoing channels to let its neighbors take a snapshot too.
When a process that has not yet taken a snapshot receives a ⟨marker⟩ message, it
takes a local snapshot of its state, and sends a ⟨marker⟩ message through all its outgoing
channels. A process q computes as channel state for an incoming channel pq
the (basic) messages that it receives via pq after taking its local snapshot and before
receiving a ⟨marker⟩ message from p. The Chandy-Lamport algorithm terminates
at a process when it has received a ⟨marker⟩ message through all its incoming
channels.
Example 3.1 We consider one possible computation of the Chandy-Lamport algorithm
on the directed network below. First, process p takes a local snapshot of its state
(dark gray), and sends ⟨marker⟩ into its two outgoing channels pq and pr. Next, p
sends a basic message m1 to process q, and changes its state (to black). Moreover,
process r receives ⟨marker⟩ from p, and as a result sends ⟨marker⟩ into its outgoing
channel rp, takes a local snapshot of its state (white), and computes the channel
state ∅ for its incoming channel pr.

Next, p receives ⟨marker⟩ from r, and as a result computes the channel state ∅ for its
incoming channel rp. Moreover, q sends a basic message m2 to r. Next, q receives
⟨marker⟩ from p, and as a result sends ⟨marker⟩ into its outgoing channel qr,
takes a local snapshot of its state (light gray), and computes the channel state ∅ for
3.2 Lai-Yang algorithm 15
its incoming channel pq. Finally, r receives m2 and next ⟨marker⟩ from q, and as a
result it computes the channel state {m2} for its incoming channel qr.

We note that the computed snapshot (states: dark gray, light gray, white; channels:
∅, ∅, ∅, {m2}) is not a configuration of the actual execution. However, the sending
ofm1 and the internal event at p that changes its state from light gray to black are
both not causally before the sending ofm2. Therefore, the snapshot is a configuration
of an execution in the same computation as the actual execution.
We argue that if an event a is causally before a presnapshot event b, then a is also
presnapshot. If a and b occur at the same process, then this is trivially the case. The
interesting case is where a is a send and b the corresponding receive event. Suppose
that a occurs at process p and b at process q. Since b is presnapshot, q has not yet
received a ⟨marker⟩ message at the time it performs b. Since channels are FIFO,
this implies p has not yet sent a ⟨marker⟩ message to q at the time it performs a.
Hence, a is presnapshot.
Moreover, a basic message m via a channel pq is included in the channel state of
pq if and only if the corresponding send event at p is presnapshot and the corresponding
receive event at q is postsnapshot. Namely, q must receive m before ⟨marker⟩ through pq; so since channels are FIFO, p must send m before ⟨marker⟩ into pq.
Furthermore, q starts computing the channel state of pq after taking it local snapshot.
The Chandy-Lamport algorithm requires E control messages, and it takes at most
O(D) time units to complete.
3.2 Lai-Yang algorithm
The Lai-Yang snapshot algorithm does not require channels to be FIFO. Any initiator
can decide to take a local snapshot of its state. As long as a process has not taken
a local snapshot, it appends false to each outgoing basic message; after its local
snapshot, it appends true to these messages. When a process that has not yet taken
a local snapshot receives a message with the tag true, it takes a local snapshot of its
state before the reception of this message. A process q computes as channel state of
an incoming channel pq the basic messages with the tag false that it receives through
this channel after having taken its local snapshot.
There are two complications. First, if after its local snapshot an initiator would
happen not to send any basic messages, other processes might never take a local
snapshot. Second, how does a process know when it can stop waiting for basic messages
with the tag false and compute the state of an incoming channel? Both issues
16 3 Snapshots
are resolved by a special control message, which a process p sends into each outgoing
channel pq after having taken its local snapshot. This control message informs
q how many basic messages with the tag false p has sent into the channel pq. In
case q has not yet taken a local snapshot, it takes one upon reception of this control
message.
Example 3.2 Consider a network of two processes p and q, with non-FIFO channels
pq and qp. We apply the Lai-Yang algorithm to take a snapshot.
Let p send basic messages ⟨m1, false⟩ and ⟨m2, false⟩ to q. Then it takes a local
snapshot of its state and sends a control message to q, reporting that p sent two
basic message with the tag false to q. Next, p sends basic messages ⟨m3, true⟩ and
⟨m4, true⟩ to q. Let ⟨m3, true⟩ arrive at q first. Then q takes a local snapshot of
its state and sends a control message to p, reporting that q did not send any basic
message with the tag false to p. Next, q waits until the control message from p,
⟨m1, false⟩, and ⟨m2, false⟩ have arrived and concludes that the channel state of pq
consists of m1 and m2. Thanks to the tag true, q recognizes that m3 and m4 are not
part of the channel state. When p receives q’s control message, it concludes that the
channel state of qp is empty.
Similar to the Chandy-Lamport algorithm, we can argue that if an event a is
causally before a presnapshot event b, then a is also presnapshot. Again, the interesting
case is where a is a send and b the corresponding receive event. Since b is
presnapshot, the message sent by a carries the tag false. Hence, a is presnapshot.
Moreover, a basic message m via a channel pq is included in the channel state
of pq if and only if the corresponding send event at p is presnapshot, and the corresponding
receive event at q is postsnapshot. Namely, m carries the tag false, and q
starts computing the channel state of pq after taking it local snapshot.
The Lai-Yang algorithm requires E control messages, and it takes at most O(D)
time units to complete for each snapshot.
Bibliographical notes
The Chandy-Lamport algorithm originates from [16]. The Lai-Yang algorithm stems
from [43]; the special control message was suggested in [55].

Waves
In distributed computing, a process often needs to gather information from all other
processes in the network. This process then typically sends a request through the
network, which incites the other processes to reply with the required information.
Notable examples are termination detection, routing, and election of a leader in the
network.
This procedure is formalized in the notion of a wave algorithm, in which each
computation, called a wave, satisfies the following three properties:
• It is finite.
• It contains one or more decide events.
• For each decide event a and process p, b ≺ a for some event b at p.
The idea behind wave algorithms is that each computation gives rise to one or more
decisions in which all processes have a say. An important characteristic of a wave
algorithm is that it does not complete if any process p refuses to take part in its
execution, because no event at p in the wave would be causally before the decide
event.
Often a wave is initiated by one process, and in the end one decide event happens,
at the initiator. If there can be concurrent calls of a wave algorithm, initiated by
different processes, then usually for each wave the messages are marked with the
ID of its initiator. In such a setting, if a wave does not complete, because a process
refuses to take part, then typically another wave will complete successfully later on
(see, for example, Rana’s termination detection algorithm in section 6.3, or the echo
algorithm with extinction for election in section 9.3).
4.1 Traversal algorithms
A traversal algorithm is a centralized wave algorithm in which the initiator sends a
token through the network. After visiting all other processes, the token returns to the
initiator, who then makes a decision. A typical example of a traversal algorithm is
the so-called ring algorithm, in which the token makes one trip around the ring.
20 4 Waves
Traversal algorithms can be used to build a spanning tree of the network, with
the initiator as the root. Each noninitiator has as parent the process from which it
received the token for the first time.
Tarry’s algorithm
Tarry’s algorithm is a traversal algorithm for undirected networks. It is based on the
following two rules:
1. A process never forwards the token through the same channel twice.
2. A process only forwards the token to its parent when there is no other option.
By applying these two rules, the token travels through each channel twice and finally
ends up at the initiator.
Example 4.1 We apply Tarry’s algorithm to the following network; p is the initiator.
q
s t
p r

The network is undirected (and unweighted); arrows and numbers mark the consecutive
steps of one possible path of the token. Solid arrows establish a parent-child
relation (in the opposite direction) in the resulting spanning tree. So the resulting
spanning tree of this execution is:
q
s t
p r
Tree edges are solid, while frond edges are dashed.
We argue that in Tarry’s algorithm the token travels through each channel twice,
once in each direction, and finally ends up at the initiator. By rule 1, the token is
never sent through the same channel in the same direction twice. Each time a noninitiator
p holds the token, it has received the token one more time than it has sent
the token to a neighbor, meaning that there is still a channel into which p has not
yet sent the token. So by rule 1, p can send the token into this channel. Hence, when
Tarry’s algorithm terminates, the token must be at the initiator. Assume, toward a
contradiction, that at the moment of termination some channel pq has not been traversed
by the token in both directions; let noninitiator p be the earliest visited process
4.1 Traversal algorithms 21
for which such a channel exists. Since by assumption all channels of the parent of p
have been traversed in both directions, in particular, p has sent the token to its parent.
So by rule 2, p must have sent the token into all its channels. Since p has sent and
received the token an equal number of times, it must have received the token through
all its channels. To conclude, the token has traveled through pq in both ways; this is
a contradiction.
Tarry’s algorithm requires 2E messages, and it takes at most 2E time units to
terminate.
Depth-first search
In a depth-first search, starting from the initiator, whenever possible, the token is
forwarded to a process that did not hold the token yet. If a process holding the token
has no unvisited neighbor, then it sends the token back to its parent, being the process
from which it received the token.
The spanning tree in example 4.1 is not a depth-first search tree, that is, it cannot
be the result of a depth-first search. Namely, in a depth-first search, processes s and
t would never both have p as their parent. In general, a spanning tree is the result of
a depth-first search if all frond edges connect an ancestor with one of its descendants
in the spanning tree (unlike the frond edge between s and t).
A depth-first search is obtained by adding one more rule to Tarry’s algorithm:
3. When a process receives the token, it immediately sends it back through the same
channel if this is allowed by rules 1 and 2.
Example 4.2 Consider the same network as in example 4.1; p is again the initiator.
Below one possible depth-first search is depicted.

s t
p r

5
In example 4.1, when p received the token from q, it forwarded it to s. However, here
p is forced to send the token back to q immediately, due to rule 3.
Depth-first search is a special case of Tarry’s algorithm, so it also takes 2E messages,
and at most 2E time units to terminate.
Sending the token back and forth through a frond edge, such as steps 3,4 and
9,10 in example 4.2, constitutes a loss of time. One obvious way to avoid this is by
including the IDs of visited processes in the token, so that a process can determine
which neighbors have already seen the token. Since the token then travels back and
forth only through the N −1 tree edges, the message complexity is reduced from 2E
to 2N −2 messages, and similarly the time complexity to at most 2N −2 time units.
22 4 Waves
The drawback, however, is that the bit complexity goes up from O(1) to O(N logN)
(assuming that O(logN) bits are needed to represent the ID of a process).
An alternative is to let a process p that holds the token for the first time inform
its neighbors (except the process that sent the token to p and the process to which p
will send the token) that it has seen the token. In Awerbuch’s depth-first search algorithm,
p waits for acknowledgments from all those neighbors before forwarding the
token, to ensure that they cannot receive the token before p’s information message. A
process marks a channel as frond edge as soon as it has received an information message
through this channel and the token through another channel. A process never
forwards the token through a frond edge. The worst-case message complexity goes
up to 4E, because frond edges carry two information messages and two acknowledgments,
while tree edges carry two forwarded tokens and possibly one information and
acknowledgment pair. Also, the worst-case time complexity goes up, to 4N −2 time
units, because tree edges carry two forwarded tokens, and each process may wait at
most two time units for acknowledgments to return.
Cidon’s depth-first search algorithm improves on Awerbuch’s algorithm by abolishing
the waiting for acknowledgments. A process p forwards the token without
delay and records to which process forwardp it forwarded the token last. In case p
receives the token back from a process q ̸= forwardp, it purges the token and marks
the channel pq as frond edge. No further action from p is required, because q will
eventually receive the information message from p. Then in turn q marks the channel
pq as frond edge, and continues to forward the token to another process (if possible).
Example 4.3 In the following undirected network, with p as initiator, one possible
computation of Cidon’s depth-first search is depicted.
p q

s r t
r forwards the token through the frond edge pr before the information message from
p reaches r. When the information message from p arrives, r continues to forward
the token to s. The information message from p reaches s before the token does, so
that s does not send the token to p.
In Cidon’s algorithm, frond edges may carry two information messages and two
acknowledgments (see exercise 4.2), so the worst-case message complexity is still
4E. But the worst-case time complexity reduces to 2N − 2 time units, because at
least once per time unit a token is forwarded through a tree edge, and the N − 1 tree
edges each carry two tokens.
4.2 Tree algorithm 23
4.2 Tree algorithm
The tree algorithm is a decentralized wave algorithm for undirected, acyclic networks.
A process p waits until it has received messages from all its neighbors except
one. Then p makes that neighbor its parent and sends a message to it. When p receives
a message from its parent, it decides. Always exactly two processes in the
network decide, and these two processes consider each other their parent.
Example 4.4 We consider one possible computation of the tree algorithm on the
following network.
u
t
s
q
p
r
– p and q send a message to r, and make r their parent. Likewise, t and u send a
message to s, and make s their parent.
– When the messages from t and u have arrived, s sends a message to r and makes
r its parent.
– When the messages from q and s have arrived, r sends a message to p and makes
p its parent.
– When p’s message has arrived, r decides. Likewise, when r’s message has arrived,
p decides.
The parent-child relations in the terminal configuration are as follows.
u
t
s
q
p
r
We argue that in each execution of the tree algorithm, exactly two processes decide.
As each process sends at most one message, each execution reaches a terminal
configuration γ. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that in γ a process p has not sent
any message, meaning that it did not receive a message through two of its channels,
say qp and rp. Since γ is terminal, q did not send a message to p, which implies it
did not receive a message through two of its channels, pq and say sq, and so forth.
Continuing this argument, we would establish a cycle of processes that did not receive
a message through two of their channels. This contradicts the assumption that
the network topology is acyclic. So in γ each process has sent a message, meaning
that there have been N messages in total. Since processes send a message into the
24 4 Waves
only channel through which they did not yet receive a message, clearly each channel
carries at least one message. An acyclic network has N − 1 channels, so exactly
one channel carries two messages. Only the two processes t and u connected by this
channel decide. All events, except for the reception of t’s message and the decision
at u, are causally before the decision at t; likewise for the decision at u.
The tree algorithm is incorrect for networks that contain a cycle, because in that
case the algorithm does not terminate. For instance, consider a ring of three processes.
Since each process has two neighbors, it will wait for a message from one of
its neighbors. Hence, all three processes wait for input, meaning that no event ever
happens.
The tree algorithm takes at most D2
time units to terminate, ifD > 1.
4.3 Echo algorithm
The echo algorithm is a centralized wave algorithm for undirected networks. It underlies
several of the distributed algorithms presented in the following chapters.
The initiator starts by sending a message to all its neighbors. Intuitively, these
messages travel in all directions, and bounce back from the corners of the network
toward the initiator. This is achieved as follows. When a noninitiator receives a message
for the first time, it makes the sender its parent, and sends a message to all
neighbors except its parent. When a noninitiator has received messages from all its
neighbors, it sends a message to its parent. Finally, when the initiator has received
messages from all its neighbors, it decides.
Example 4.5 We consider one possible computation of the echo algorithm on the
following network.
q
s t
p r
– p sends messages to q, s, and t.
– p’s message arrives at q, who makes p its parent and sends messages to r, s, and
t.
– q’s message arrives at t, who makes q its parent and sends messages to p and s.
– q’s message arrives at r, who makes q its parent. Since r has no other neighbors,
it sends a message to its parent q straightaway.
– p’s message arrives at s, who makes p its parent and sends messages to q and t.
– p’s and s’s message arrive at t, who sends a message to its parent q.
– r’s, s’s, and t’s message arrive at q, who sends a message to its parent p.
Exercises 25
– q’s and t’s message arrive at s, who sends a message to its parent p.
– q’s, s’s, and t’s message arrive at p, who decides.
The resulting spanning tree is as follows.
q
s t
p r
We argue that the echo algorithm is a wave algorithm. Clearly, it constructs a
spanning tree that covers the entire network. When a noninitiator joins this tree, at
reception of a message from its parent, it sends a message to all its other neighbors.
Moreover, the initiator sends a message to all its neighbors. Hence, through each
frond edge, one message travels either way. We argue by induction on the size of the
network that each noninitiator eventually sends a message to its parent. Consider a
leaf p in the spanning tree. Eventually, p will receive a message from all its neighbors
(as only the channel to its parent is a tree edge), and send a message to its parent.
When this message arrives, we can consider the network without p, in which by
induction each noninitiator eventually sends a message to its parent. We conclude
that through each channel one message travels either way. So eventually the initiator
receives a message from all its neighbors, and decides. All messages are causally
before this decision.
In total, the echo algorithm takes 2E messages, and it takes at most 2N −2 time
units to terminate.

Deadlock Detection
A process may wait for other processes to send or be ready to receive some input,
or for some resource to become available. A deadlock occurs if a process is doomed
to wait forever. This happens if there is a cycle of processes waiting either for each
other or for a resource occupied by another process in the cycle. The first type of
deadlock is called a communication deadlock, while the second type is called a resource
deadlock.
Deadlock detection is a fundamental problem in distributed computing, which
requires determining a permanent cyclic dependency within a running system. For
this purpose, the global configuration of the distributed system is regularly examined
by individual processes to detect whether a deadlock has occurred. That is, snapshots
are taken of the global configuration of the system, and these are examined for
cycles. In case a deadlock is detected, the basic algorithm may be rolled back and
processes may be restarted in order to remove the detected deadlock. Here we focus
on detection of deadlocks and ignore rollback.
5.1 Wait-for graphs
A wait-for graph depicts dependencies between processes and resources. A node in
a wait-for graph can represent either a process or a resource. Both communication
and resource deadlocks can be captured by so-called N-out-of-M requests, where
N ≤ M. For example, if a process is waiting for one message from a group of M
processes, then N = 1; or, if a database transaction first has to lock M files, then
N = M.
A nonblocked node u in a wait-for graph can issue an N-out-of-M request,
meaning that it sends a request to M other nodes and becomes blocked until N
of these requests have been granted. In the wait-for graph, a directed edge is drawn
from u to each of theM nodes to which u issued the N-out-of-M request. Only nonblocked
nodes can grant a request. Every time a node v grants u’s request, the edge
uv can be removed from the wait-for graph. When N requests have been granted, u
becomes unblocked and informs the remainingM −N nodes that u’s request can be
28 5 Deadlock Detection
purged; accordingly, the M − N outgoing edges of u are removed from the wait-for
graph.
The following example shows how a wait-for graph can be used to model communication
deadlocks.
Example 5.1 Suppose process p must wait for amessage from process q. In the waitfor
graph, p sends a request to q; as a result, an edge pq is created and p becomes
blocked. When q sends a message to p, the request from p is granted. Then the edge
pq is removed from the wait-for graph, and p becomes unblocked.
The following example shows how a wait-for graph can be used to model resource
deadlocks.
Example 5.2 Suppose two different processes p and q want to claim a resource,
while at any time only one process can own the resource.
– Nodes u and v, representing p and q, respectively, send a request to node w,
representing the resource. As a result, in the wait-for graph, edges uw and vw
are created.
– The resource is free, and w sends a grant to say u, so that p can claim the resource.
In the wait-for graph, the edge uw is removed.
– The resource must be released by p before q can claim it. Therefore, w sends a
request to u, creating an edge wu in the wait-for graph.
– After p releases the resource, u grants the request from w. Then the edge wu is
removed from the wait-for graph.
– Now w can grant the request from v, so that q can claim the resource. In the
wait-for graph, the edge vw is removed and an edge wv is created.
In wait-for graphs, an M-out-of-M request withM > 1 (also called AND request)
is drawn with an arc through the M edges, while a 1-out-of-M request (also
called OR request) is drawn without an arc. For example, for M = 3,
AND (3-out-of-3) request OR (1-out-of-3) request
The examples in this chapter do not contain any N-out-of-M requests with 1 < N <
M.
5.2 Bracha-Toueg algorithm 29
5.2 Bracha-Toueg algorithm
To try to detect a deadlock with regard to an ongoing execution of a basic algorithm,
first a snapshot can be taken of the corresponding wait-for graph. A process that
suspects it is deadlocked, starts a Lai-Yang snapshot to compute the wait-for graph
(see section 3.2). To distinguish subsequent snapshots, snapshots (and their control
messages) are tagged with a sequence number. Each node u takes a local snapshot to
determine the requests it sent or received that were not yet granted or purged, taking
into account the grant and purge messages in the snapshot of its incoming edges.
Then it computes two sets of nodes:
• Outu: the nodes u has sent a request to that were not yet granted or purged.
• Inu: the nodes u has received a request from that were not yet granted or purged.
A static analysis on the computed wait-for graph may reveal deadlocks:
• Nonblocked nodes in the wait-for graph can grant requests.
• When a request has been granted, the corresponding edge in the wait-for graph
is removed.
• When a node u with an outstanding N-out-of-M request has received N grants,
u becomes unblocked. The remainingM−N outgoing edges of u in the wait-for
graph are removed.
When no more grants are possible, nodes that are still blocked in the wait-for graph
are deadlocked in the snapshot of the basic algorithm.
We consider two examples. Granted requests are drawn as dashed arrows (they
are no longer part of the wait-for graph).
Example 5.3 The next wait-for graph contains three 2-out-of-2 requests. Blocked
nodes are colored gray.
v w
u
v w
x u x
The unblocked node x grants the three incoming requests. After that the three other
nodes remain blocked, so no other requests can be granted. Hence, these three nodes
are deadlocked.
Example 5.4 The next wait-for graph contains two 2-out-of-2 requests and one 1-
out-of-2 request.
30 5 Deadlock Detection
v w
u
v w
x u x
The unblocked node x grants the three incoming requests. As a result node w becomes
unblocked, which purges its remaining request to v and grants the incoming
request from u. Next, node u becomes unblocked, which grants the last pending
request in the graph.
v w
u
v w
x u x
Finally, all nodes have become unblocked, so no nodes are found to be deadlocked.
Let the basic algorithm run on an undirected network, and suppose a wait-for
graph has been computed. The Bracha-Toueg deadlock detection algorithm provides
a distributed method to perform the static analysis for cleaning out the wait-for graph
to try to find deadlocks. The nodes in the wait-for graph start to resolve grants, in the
manner described before. Initially, requestsu is the number of grants node u requires
in the wait-for graph to become unblocked. When requestsu is or becomes 0, u sends
grant messages to all nodes in Inu. When u receives a grant message, requestsu ← requestsu −1. If after termination of this deadlock detection run requests > 0 at the
initiator, then it is deadlocked in the basic algorithm.
A key question is how to determine that deadlock detection has terminated. In
principle, nodes could apply a termination detection algorithm from chapter 6. However,
the Bracha-Toueg algorithm is designed in such a way that termination detection
comes for free. We now explain in detail how the nodes choreograph cleaning
out the wait-for graph. Initially, notifiedu = false and freeu = false at all nodes
u; these two variables ensure that u executes at most once the routine Notifyu and
Grantu, respectively, given below. The initiator v of deadlock detection starts the
resolution of grants throughout the wait-for graph by executing Notifyv. It consists
of sending a notify message into all outgoing edges, and executing Grantv in case
requestsv = 0. Noninitiators u that receive a notify message for the first time
execute Notifyu. Moreover, nodes u that are or become unblocked, meaning that
requestsu = 0, grant all pending requests, by executing Grantu. The pseudocode
for the procedure Notifyu is:
5.2 Bracha-Toueg algorithm 31
notifiedu ← true;
send ⟨notify⟩ to all w ∈ Outu;
if requestsu = 0 then
perform procedure Grantu;
end if
await ⟨done⟩ from all w ∈ Outu;
And the pseudocode for the procedure Grantu is:
freeu ← true;
send ⟨grant⟩ to all w ∈ Inu;
await ⟨ack⟩ from all w ∈ Inu;
Note that since Grantu is a subcall of Notifyu, waiting for ack messages postpones
the sending of done messages.
If a node u receives a notify message from a neighbor v, it does the following:
if notifiedu = false then
perform procedure Notifyu;
end if
send ⟨done⟩ to v;
If a node u receives a grant message from a neighbor v, it does the following:
if requestsu > 0 then
requestsu ← requestsu − 1;
if requestsu = 0 then
perform procedure Grantu;
end if
end if
send ⟨ack⟩ to v;
Note that if u receives a notify message and notifiedu = true (meaning that u
already executed Notifyu), or a grant message and the assignment requestsu ← requestsu − 1 does not set requestsu from 1 to 0 (meaning that u does not become
unblocked by the grant message), then u immediately sends back a done or ack
message, respectively.
While a node is awaiting done or ack messages, it can process incoming notify
and grant messages. The done (and ack) messages are used for termination detection.
That is, when the initiator v has received a done message from all nodes in
Outv, it checks the value of freev. If it is still false, v concludes that it is deadlocked.
32 5 Deadlock Detection
Example 5.5 Suppose the following wait-for graph, consisting of one 2-out-of-2

and must await an ack from both u and w before it can send a done back to u.

is received at u, who sends an ack back to x immediately, because the grant
decreases requestsu from 2 to 1. Next, the grant from x is received at w, who
sends a grant to v, because requestsw decreases from 1 to 0, and must await an
ack from v before it can send an ack back to x.

We argue that when the initiator completes its Notify call, the Bracha-Toueg algorithm
has terminated. The idea is that we can distinguish two types of trees. First,
by assuming that each node receiving a notify message for the first time makes the
sender its parent, we obtain a tree T rooted in the initiator. The notify/done messages
construct T and travel through (part of) the network similar to the echo algorithm
(see section 4.3). Second, by assuming that each node receiving a grant message
that sets requests to 0 makes the sender its parent, we obtain disjoint trees Tv,
each rooted in a node v where from the start requestsv = 0. Again, the grant/ack
messages construct Tv and travel through the network similar to the echo algorithm.
A noninitiator v that is the root of a tree Tv only sends a done to its parent in T when
all grant’s sent by nodes in Tv have been acknowledged. This implies that when the
initiator completes its Notify call, not only all notify’s but also all grant’s in the
Exercises 35
network have been acknowledged. So at that moment there are no messages in transit
or pending messages.
We argue that the Bracha-Toueg algorithm is deadlock-free. That is, the initiator
will eventually complete its Notify call. Namely, replying with a done (to a notify)
or ack (to a grant) is delayed by a node u only if it is executing Grantu because
requestsu is 0 (in case of done) or has become 0 by the grant (in case of an ack),
and u is awaiting ack’s. We note that there cannot be a cycle of nodes that sent a
grant to the next node and must wait before sending an ack to the previous node in
the cycle: such a cycle would always contain a node v of which requestsv was not
set to 0 by a grant from a node in this cycle. This implies that always some node
will be able to respond to a pending notify or grant.
As we said before, if after resolving the wait-for graph the initiator remains
blocked, then it is deadlocked in the snapshot. Namely, the Bracha-Toueg algorithm
cleans out the part of the wait-for graph that is reachable from the initiator as much
as possible. So if the initiator remains blocked, this means it is part of a cycle of
nodes waiting for each other.
In case of a communication deadlock (see example 5.1) the other direction also
holds: if the initiator is deadlocked when the snapshot is taken, then it will remain
blocked in the wait-for graph. In case of resource deadlock this only holds if resource
requests are granted nondeterministically (see exercise 5.6). Namely, as shown in example
5.2, modeling resource deadlock means that removing one edge (in the example,
wu) may automatically mean the introduction of another edge (in the example,
wv). The Bracha-Toueg approach to resolving edges in wait-for graphs does not take
into account this automatic creation of edges.

The Bracha-Toueg algorithm originates from [12].

Termination Detection
In the previous chapter we looked at deadlocks, in which some processes are doomed
to wait for input forever. In the current chapter we turn our attention to the related
problem of termination. A distributed algorithm is terminated if all processes are in
a terminal state and no (basic) messages are in transit. Termination detection is a
fundamental and challenging problem in distributed computing because no process
has complete knowledge of the global configuration of the network. Moreover, a terminated
process may be reactivated by a message from another process, and absence
of messages in the network must be established.
The basic algorithm is the algorithm for which termination is being detected,
and the control algorithm is the termination detection algorithm employed for this
task. The control algorithm in general consists of two parts: termination detection
and announcement. The announcement part, called Announce, is straightforward; we
therefore focus on the termination detection part. Ideally, termination detection does
not require freezing the basic execution.
From the viewpoint of the control algorithm, a simple description of the process
states in the basic algorithm suffices. A process is either in an active state if it has not
terminated yet, or in a passive state if it has terminated. We are moreover interested
in send and receive events, to determine whether there are basic messages under way.
As for internal events, we are only interested in those that change a process state from
active to passive. A passive process becomes active again upon reception of a basic
message. So the abstract view on processes is as follows.
active
receive
send
receive
passive
internal
We will consider termination detection techniques based on maintaining trees of
active processes (section 6.1), dividing a fixed weight over the active processes and
basic messages (section 6.2), waves tagged with logical clock values (section 6.3),
and token-based traversal (section 6.4).
38 6 Termination Detection
6.1 Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm
The Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm is a termination detection algorithm for a centralized
basic algorithm on an undirected network. The idea is to build a tree, rooted in
the initiator of the basic algorithm, which contains all active processes, and passive
ones that have active descendants in the tree. If a basic message from a process p
makes a process q active, then q becomes a child of p in the tree. A process can quit
the tree only if it is passive and has no children left in the tree. In that case, it informs
its parent that it is no longer a child. Termination is detected by the initiator when
the tree has disappeared.
To be more precise, initially the tree T consists only of the initiator. Each process
p maintains a child counter ccp that estimates from above its number of children in
T. Initially, this counter is zero at all processes. The control algorithm works as follows.
When a process p sends a basic message m, it increases ccp by one, because
the receiver q may become active upon reception of m. When the message arrives at
q, either q joins T with parent p if q was not yet in T, or otherwise q sends an acknowledgment
to p that it is not a new child. Upon reception of an acknowledgment,
p decreases ccp by one. When a process in T is passive and its counter is zero, it
quits T. When a noninitiator quits T, it sends an acknowledgment to its parent that
it is no longer its child. Finally, when the initiator quits T, it calls Announce.
Example 6.1 We consider one possible computation of a basic algorithm supplied
with the Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm, on an undirected ring of three processes p, q, r.
– At the start, the initiator p sends basic messages to q and r, and sets ccp to 2.
Upon receipt of these messages, q and r both become active, and join T with
parent p.
– q sends a basic message to r, and sets ccq to 1. Upon receipt of this message, r
sends back an acknowledgment, which causes q to decrease ccq to 0.
– p becomes passive. (Since ccp = 2, it remains in T.)
– r becomes passive. Since ccr = 0, it sends an acknowledgment to its parent p,
which causes p to decrease ccp to 1.
– q sends a basic message to r, and sets ccq to 1.
– q becomes passive. (Since ccq = 1, it remains in T.)
– Note that all three processes are now passive, but there is still a message traveling
from q to r. Upon receipt of this message, r becomes active again, and joins T
with parent q.
– r becomes passive. Since ccr = 0, it sends an acknowledgment to its parent q,
which causes q to decrease ccq to 0.
– Since q is passive and ccq = 0, it sends an acknowledgment to its parent p, which
causes p to decrease ccp to 0.
– Since p is passive and ccp = 0, it calls Announce.
When all processes have become passive and all basic messages have been acknowledged,
clearly the tree T will eventually disappear, and the initiator will call
6.2 Weight-throwing algorithm 39
Announce. Conversely, since active processes and processes that sent a basic message
that did not yet reach its destination are guaranteed to be in T, the initiator only
calls Announce when the basic algorithm has terminated.
The Shavit-Francez algorithm generalizes the Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm to decentralized
basic algorithms. The idea is to maintain not one tree, but a forest of
(disjoint) trees, one for each initiator. Initially, each initiator constitutes a tree in the
forest. A process can only join a tree if it is not yet in a tree in the forest. For the
rest, the algorithm proceeds exactly as the Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm. The only
distinction is that when an initiator detects that its tree has disappeared, it cannot
immediately call Announce. Instead, the initiator starts a wave, tagged with its ID,
in which only processes that are not in a tree participate, and the decide event calls
Announce. If such a wave does not complete, this is not a problem, because then another
initiator of which the tree has not yet disappeared will start a subsequent wave.
And the last tree to disappear is guaranteed to start a wave that will complete.
Example 6.2 We consider one possible computation of a basic algorithm supplied
with the Shavit-Francez algorithm, on an undirected ring of three processes p, q, r.
– At the start, the initiators p and q both send a basic message to r, and set ccp and
ccq to 1. Next, p and q become passive.
– Upon receipt of the basic message from p, r becomes active and makes p its
parent. Next, r receives the basic message from q, and sends back an acknowledgment,
which causes q to decrease ccq to 0.
– Since q became passive as the root of a tree, and ccq = 0, it starts a wave. This
wave does not complete, because p and r refuse to participate.
– r sends a basic message to q, and sets ccr to 1. Next, r becomes passive.
– Upon receipt of the basic message from r, q becomes active, and makes r its
parent. Next, q becomes passive, and sends an acknowledgment to its parent r,
which causes r to decrease ccr to 0.
– Since r is passive and ccr = 0, it sends an acknowledgment to its parent p, which
causes p to decrease ccp to 0.
– Since p became passive as the root of a tree, and ccp = 0, it starts a wave. This
wave completes, so that p calls Announce.
6.2 Weight-throwing algorithm
In weight-throwing termination detection, for a centralized basic algorithm on a directed
network, the initiator is given a certain amount of weight. During a computation,
this weight is divided over active processes and basic messages in transit. Every
time a basic message is sent, the sender transfers some (but not all) of its weight
to the message. And every time a basic message is received, the receiver adds the
weight of the message to its own weight. When a noninitiator becomes passive, it
returns its weight to the initiator (possibly via some other processes, in case there is
no direct channel to the initiator). When the initiator is passive and has regained its
original weight, it calls Announce.
40 6 Termination Detection
Example 6.3 We consider one possible computation of a basic algorithm supplied
with the weight-throwing algorithm on an undirected ring of three processes p, q, r.
– At the start, the initiator p has weight 12. It sends basic messages to q and r, with
weight 6 and 3, respectively, and reduces its own weight to 3. Upon receipt of
these messages, q and r become active, with weight 6 and 3.
– q sends a basic message to r, with weight 3, and reduces its own weight to 3.
Upon receipt of this message, r increases its weight to 6.
– p becomes passive. (Since it has weight less than 12, it does not yet call Announce.)
– r becomes passive, and sends a control message to p, returning its weight 6. Upon
receipt of this message, p increases its weight to 9.
– q sends a basic message to r, with weight 1.5, and reduces its own weight to 1.5.
– q becomes passive, and sends a control message to p, returning its weight 1.5. At
receipt of this message, p increases its weight to 10.5.
– Note that all three processes are now passive, but there is still a message traveling
from q to r. Upon receipt of this message, r becomes active again, with weight
1.5.
– r becomes passive again. It sends a control message to p, returning its weight
1.5. At receipt of this message, p increases its weight to 12. Since p is passive, it
calls Announce.
When all processes have become passive and there are no basic messages in
transit, clearly all weight will eventually be returned to the initiator, who will then
call Announce. Conversely, since all active processes and basic messages carry some
weight, it is guaranteed that the initiator detects termination only when all processes
are passive and there are no basic messages in transit.
The Achilles heel of this simple and effective termination detection scheme is
underflow: the weight at a process can become too small to be divided further. Two
solutions have been proposed for this problem.
The first solution is that a process p where underflow occurs gives itself extra
weight. If p is a noninitiator, it must send a control message to the initiator that more
weight has been introduced in the system, for else the initiator could call Announce
prematurely. To avoid race conditions, p must wait for an acknowledgment from the
initiator before it can continue sending basic messages. Otherwise, the initiator could
regain its original weight before the control message from p has reached it.
The second solution is that p starts a weight-throwing termination detection subcall.
Then p only returns its weight to the initiator when it has become passive and its
subcall has terminated. The weights originating from the initiator and from p must
be maintained separately.
6.3 Rana’s algorithm
Rana’s algorithm detects termination for a decentralized basic algorithm on an undirected
network. It exploits waves that carry a clock value provided by a logical clock
6.3 Rana’s algorithm 41
(see chapter 2). Each basic message is acknowledged, so that a process can determine
whether all the basic messages it sent have reached their destination.
To understand Rana’s algorithm, it is helpful to first consider an incorrect termination
detection algorithm, which uses waves without clock values. Let a process
become quiet if (1) it is passive, and (2) all the basic messages it sent have been
acknowledged. Then it starts a wave, tagged with its ID. Only quiet processes take
part in this wave. If a wave completes, its initiator calls Announce. Note that there
can be multiple concurrent waves; each process must keep track of its state in each
of these waves.
The problem with this termination detection algorithm is that a process p that was
not yet visited by a wave may make a quiet process q that already took part in the
wave active again. After that p may become quiet, and take part in the wave. Then
the wave can complete while q is active.
To avoid this scenario, a logical clock provides each event with a time stamp. The
time stamp of a process is the highest time stamp of its events so far (initially it is
zero). As we said, each basic message is acknowledged, and a process becomes quiet
if (1) it is passive, and (2) all the basic messages it sent have been acknowledged.
Then it starts a wave, tagged with its ID and its time stamp t. Only quiet processes
that have been quiet from some logical time ≤ t onward take part in this wave. If a
wave completes, its initiator calls Announce.
Actually, Rana’s algorithm does not require a full-blown logical clock. It suffices
if only the control messages (acknowledgments and wave messages) are taken into
account. That is, a wave tagged with time stamp t puts the clock of each recipient to
t (if its value is not ≥ t already), and each acknowledgment is tagged with the time
stamp t′ of the sender and puts the clock of the receiver to t′ + 1 (if its value is not
≥ t′ + 1 already).
Example 6.4 We consider one possible computation of a basic algorithm supplied
with Rana’s algorithm, using logical time stamps, on an undirected ring of three
processes p, q, r.
– Initially, p, q, and r all have logical time 0, and only p is active. It sends basic
messages m1 to q and m2 to r. The corresponding receive events of these
messages make q and r active. Next, they send an acknowledgment ⟨a1, 0⟩ and
⟨a2, 0⟩ to p, respectively.
– p and q become passive. Moreover, p receives both acknowledgments, setting its
time to 1. Next, p and q both start a wave, tagged with 1 and 0, respectively. The
wave of p first visits q, setting its time to 1; q takes part in the wave, because it is
quiet from time 0 onward. The wave of q first visits r, which refuses to take part
in the wave, because it is active.
– r sends a basic message m3 to q. Upon receipt of this message, q becomes active
and sends back an acknowledgment ⟨a3, 1⟩. When r receives this acknowledgment,
its clock value becomes 2.
– q and r become passive. Next, r refuses to take part in p’s wave, because r is
quiet from time 2 onward, while the wave is tagged with 1.
42 6 Termination Detection
– q and r both start a wave, tagged with 1 and 2, respectively. The wave of r
completes, and r calls Announce.
We argue that Rana’s algorithm is a correct termination detection algorithm.
When the basic algorithm has terminated, Rana’s algorithm will eventually call Announce.
Namely, each process eventually becomes quiet, when all the basic message
it sent have been acknowledged; and when a process becomes quiet, it starts a wave.
Suppose a wave, tagged with some time stamp t, does not complete. Then some process
does not take part in the wave, so (by the wave) it is not quiet at some time > t.
When that process becomes quiet, it starts another wave, tagged with some t′ > t.
This implies that when all processes have become quiet, eventually some wave, with
the largest time stamp among all waves, is guaranteed to complete.
Conversely, when Rana’s algorithm calls Announce, the basic algorithm has terminated.
Namely, let a wave complete. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that at that
moment the basic algorithm has not terminated. Then some process is active, or some
basic message is in transit. Since only quiet processes take part in a wave, such a situation
can arise only if a quiet process p was first visited by the wave, and then made
active again by a basic message m from a process q that was not yet visited by the
wave. Note that q can take part in the wave only after it has received an acknowledgment
for m from p. Let the wave be tagged with time stamp t. When p takes part in
the wave, its logical time becomes at least t. So the acknowledgment from p to q sets
the logical time of q to a value greater than t. However, this means that q is not quiet
from a logical time ≤ t, so it cannot take part in the wave. This contradicts the fact
that the wave completes. So at the moment the wave completes, the basic algorithm
must have terminated.
6.4 Safra’s algorithm
Safra’s algorithm is a traversal-based termination detection algorithm. A token visits
every process in the network, and only passive processes can forward the token.
Although Safra’s algorithm is centralized, the basic algorithm can be decentralized.
The network can be directed. Note that a traversal of the entire network is always
feasible, owing to the fact that networks are assumed to be strongly connected.
There are two complications. First, it must be determined whether there are basic
messages in transit. In case of a directed network, there is no simple acknowledgment
scheme for basic messages. The second complication is that a traversal of passive
processes does not guarantee termination. Namely, a traversal-based algorithm can
give rise to an execution similar to the counterexample to the flawed termination
detection algorithm presented at the start of section 6.3. An active process p may
make a passive process that was already visited by the token active again, after which
p becomes passive and forwards the token.
To cope with these complications, in Safra’s algorithm every process maintains
a counter of type integer; initially it is zero. At each outgoing or incoming basic
message, the counter is increased or decreased, respectively. Each round trip, the
token carries the sum of the counters of the processes it has traversed.
6.4 Safra’s algorithm 43
At any time, the sum of all counters in the network is nonnegative, and it is zero
if and only if no basic message is in transit. Still, the token may compute a negative
sum for a round trip, if a passive process that already forwarded the token receives
a basic message, becomes active, and sends basic messages that are received by a
process before this same token arrives.
This scenario is dealt with by coloring processes black after receiving a basic
message. Initially, all processes are white. When the initiator of the control algorithm
becomes passive, it sends a white token, carrying integer value 0, and the initiator
becomes white. When a process receives the token, it adds its counter value to
the integer value of the token. A noninitiator must wait until it is passive, and then
forwards the token. A white noninitiator leaves the color of the token unchanged.
A black noninitiator colors the token black, while the process itself becomes white.
Eventually, the token returns to the initiator. If the token and the initiator are white,
and the integer value of the token is zero, then the initiator calls Announce. Otherwise,
the initiator waits until it is passive, sends a white token carrying integer value
0 again, and becomes white.
Example 6.5 We consider one possible computation of a basic algorithm supplied
with Safra’s algorithm on the following directed network.
q
s r
p
Initially, the token is at the initiator p, only s is active, all processes are white with
counter 0, and there are no messages in transit. First, s sends a basic message m to
q, setting the counter of s to 1. Now s becomes passive. The token travels around the
network, and returns to p white with sum 1. Next, the token travels on from p via q to
r, white with sum 0. The message m travels to q and back to s, making them active
and black, with counter 0. Now s becomes passive, and the token travels from r via
s to p, black with sum 0. Note that s becomes white. Finally, q becomes passive, and
after two more round trips of the token (one round trip is needed to color q white), p
calls Announce.
When all processes have become passive, the token will eventually color them
all white. And when there are no messages in transit, the counters of the processes
sum up to zero. So in that case the token will return to the initiator colored white
and with integer value zero, after which the initiator calls Announce. Conversely, if
the token returns to the initiator colored white, all processes have been passive and
did not receive any messages since the completion of the previous round trip of the
token. If, moreover, the token has integer value zero, this implies that no messages
are in transit. Hence, the basic algorithm has terminated.
44 6 Termination Detection
An optimization of Safra’s algorithm does away with black tokens. Instead, when
a black process p holds the token, it purges the token. As soon as p is passive, it
becomes white and sends a fresh token, carrying the counter value of p, and tagged
with the p’s ID. Suppose the token completes the round trip, meaning that it reaches
p, tagged with p. As soon as p is passive, it checks whether p is white and the token’s
integer value is zero. If so, p calls Announce. Otherwise, p purges the token, becomes
white, and sends a fresh token, as explained earlier.
Bibliographical notes
The Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm originates from [26], and the Shavit-Francez algorithm
from [72].Weight throwing was proposed in [54]. Rana’s algorithm stems from
[66]. Safra’s algorithm was presented in [25].
Exercises
Exercise 6.1 [76] How much time does the Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm need at
most to call Announce after the basic algorithm has terminated?
Exercise 6.2 Give a computation of the Shavit-Francez algorithm with two initiators,
in which one of the initiators becomes active again after it has become passive,
and both initiators concurrently call Announce.
Exercise 6.3 Consider weight-throwing termination detection, where in case of underflow
at a process p, it gives itself extra weight, and informs the initiator. Give an
example to show that if p would not wait for an acknowledgment from the initiator,
then the initiator could prematurely detect termination.
Exercise 6.4 Consider the following computation of a decentralized basic algorithm
on an undirected ring of size three, with processes p, q and r, where p and q are the
initiators. First, p sends a message to q and r and becomes passive, while q sends a
message to r. When q receives p’s message, it also becomes passive. After reception
of the messages from first p and then q, r sends a message to both p and q and
becomes passive. After reception of the message from r, p and q send a message to
each other, and after reception of these messages become passive.
Add the following termination detection algorithms on top of the basic algorithm,
and in each case extend the computation with control messages, to explain how termination
is detected.
(a) The Shavit-Francez algorithm.
(b) Rana’s algorithm.
(c) Safra’s algorithm, with p as initiator of this control algorithm.
Exercises 45
Exercise 6.5 Suppose that Rana’s algorithm is adapted as follows: only quiet processes
that have been quiet from some logical time < t (instead of ≤ t) onward can
take part in a wave tagged with time stamp t. Give an example of a finite computation
for which termination would not be detected.
Exercise 6.6 Give an example to show that in Safra’s algorithm, coloring sending
processes black (instead of receiving ones) is incorrect.
Exercise 6.7 In Safra’s algorithm, certain messages do not need to color the receiver
black. Only messages that are sent after a token visits the sender and that are received
before this same token visits the receiver have to be taken into account. Propose an
optimization of Safra’s algorithm based on this observation.
Exercise 6.8 [76] Safra’s algorithm can be viewed as a snapshot algorithm. Every
tour of the token, each process takes a local snapshot when it handles the token. In
the constructed snapshot all processes are passive, because the token is handled only
by passive processes. Explain how the token’s message integer color and value (when
the token arrives back at the initiator) capture the consistency and channel states of
the snapshot. In particular, argue that the following two claims are true.
1. If the token is white, the snapshot is consistent.
2. If moreover the token’s integer value is zero, all channels are empty.

Garbage Collection
Each process is provided with memory to store, for example, its local state. An object
in memory can carry references to other objects, possibly in the memory of other
processes. A reference to a local object, which is located at the same process, is
called a pointer, to distinguish it from a reference to a remote object, which is located
at another process. An object needs to be kept in memory only if it is accessible by
navigating from a root object. An object is garbage if it cannot be accessed from any
root object.
Garbage collection aims to automatically detect and reclaim inaccessible memory
objects, in order to free up memory space. The two main techniques for garbage
collection are reference counting and tracing. Reference counting, which counts the
number of references to an object, is discussed in section 7.1. Tracing, which marks
all objects reachable from the root objects, is discussed in section 7.3.
7.1 Reference counting
Reference counting is based on keeping track of the number of references to an
object; if it drops to zero, and there are no pointers to the object, the object is garbage.
An advantage of reference counting is that it can be easily performed at runtime.
A disadvantage is that cyclic garbage, that is, a cycle of references between
garbage objects, is not detected. A separate technique must be added to try and detect
such cycles. For instance, a nonroot object that is suspected to be part of cyclic
garbage may be virtually deleted. That is, a separate set of reference counts is used
to propagate the effects of this trial deletion. If the trial count of the trial-deleted
object drops to zero, then it confirms that the object is garbage. In that case, it can be
physically deleted.
The owner of an object O, that is, the process where O is located, can easily
count the (local) pointers to O. But the challenge is to keep track of the number of
(remote) O-references. We distinguish three operations in which processes build or
delete a reference to an object O:
48 7 Garbage Collection
• Creation: the owner of O sends an O-pointer to another process.
• Duplication: a process that is not the owner of O sends an O-reference to another
process.
• Deletion: an O-reference is deleted, because it has become obsolete.
Reference counting must take into account messages that duplicate a reference.
Otherwise, an object could be reclaimed prematurely, if there are no pointers and
references to it, but a message is carrying a duplicated reference to this object. One
solution is that a process wanting to duplicate a reference must first inform the object
owner; the reference is duplicated only after the receipt of the owner’s acknowledgment.
The drawback of this approach is high synchronization delays.We now discuss
two different approaches to avoid such delays.
Indirect reference counting
One method to avoid having to inform the object owner when a reference is duplicated
is to maintain a tree for each object, with the object at the root, and the references
to this object as the other nodes in the tree. Each reference keeps track where
it was duplicated or created from, that is, it stores its parent in the tree. Objects and
references are provided with a counter, estimating from above how many children
they have in the tree: the counter at an object keeps track how many references to
the object have been created, while the counter at a reference keeps track how many
times the reference has been duplicated.
When a process receives a reference to an object but already holds a reference to
or owns this object, it sends back a decrement to decrease the counter at the sender.
A deleted reference can be restored, in case a duplication or creation of this reference
is received before its counter has become zero.
When a duplicated (or created) reference has been deleted, and its counter is
zero, a decrement message is sent to the process where it was duplicated from (or
to the object owner). When the counter of the object becomes zero, and there are no
pointers to it, the object can be reclaimed.
Example 7.1 We consider one possible computation with indirect reference counting,
on an undirected ring of three processes p, q, r. Let p hold one pointer to the
object O.
– p sends O-references to q and r, and sets its counter of created O-references to
2. Upon receipt of these messages, q and r build an O-reference.
– q sends an O-reference to r, and increases its counter of duplicated O-references
to 1. Upon receipt of this message, r sends back a decrement message to q, because
it already holds an O-reference. Upon receipt of this message, q decreases
its counter back to 0.
– p deletes its O-pointer. (Since its counter is 2, O cannot yet be reclaimed by the
garbage collector.)
– r deletes its O-reference. Since its counter is 0, r sends a decrement message to
p, which causes p to decrease its counter to 1.
7.1 Reference counting 49
– q sends an O-reference to r, and increases its counter to 1.
– q deletes its O-reference. (Since its counter is 1, q does not yet send a decrement
message to p.)
– Note that there is no pointer or reference to O, but there is still an O-reference
traveling from q to r. Upon receipt of this message, r builds an O-reference.
– r deletes its O-reference. Since its counter is 0, r sends a decrement message to
q, which causes q to decrease its counter to 0.
– Since q holds no O-reference and its counter is 0, it sends a decrement message
to p, which causes p to decrease its counter to 0.
– Since p holds no O-pointer and its counter is 0, O can be reclaimed by the
garbage collector.
Weighted reference counting
Another method to avoid having to inform the object owner when a reference is
duplicated is to provide each object with a total weight. References are provided
with a part of the weight of the object to which they refer. Each object maintains a
partial weight that was not yet handed out to references to the object. Initially, the
partial weight of an object equals its total weight.
When a reference is created, the partial weight of the object is divided over the
object and the reference. That is, the object owner gives some weight to the message
responsible for creating this reference, and it deducts this weight from the partial
weight of the object. When the message arrives at its destination, either the reference
is created with the weight of the message, if the process does not yet hold a
reference to this object, or the weight of the message is added to this reference otherwise.
Likewise, when a reference is duplicated, the weight of the reference is divided
over itself and the copy (except when the reference happens to be duplicated to the
object owner, in which case the weight is subtracted from the total weight of the
object). When a reference is deleted, the object owner is notified, and the weight of
the deleted reference is subtracted from the total weight of the object. When the total
weight of the object becomes equal to its partial weight, and there are no pointers to
the object, it can be reclaimed.
Example 7.2 We consider one possible computation with weighted reference counting,
on an undirected ring of three processes p, q, r. Let p hold one pointer to the
object O, which has total and partial weight 12.
– p sends O-references to q and r, with weight 6 and 3, respectively, and reduces
the partial weight of O to 3. Upon receipt of these messages, q and r build an
O-reference, with weight 6 and 3.
– q sends an O-reference to r, with weight 3, and reduces the weight of its Oreference
to 3. Upon receipt of this message, r increases the weight of its Oreference
to 6.
– p deletes its O-pointer. (Since the partial weight of O is less than its total weight,
O cannot yet be reclaimed by the garbage collector.)
50 7 Garbage Collection
– r deletes its O-reference, and sends a control message to p with weight 6. Upon
receipt of this message, p decreases the total weight of O to 6.
– q sends an O-reference to r, with weight 1.5, and decreases the weight of its
O-reference to 1.5.
– q deletes its O-reference, and sends a control message to p with weight 1.5. Upon
receipt of this message, p decreases the total weight of O to 4.5.
– Note that there is no pointer or reference to O, but there is still an O-reference
traveling from q to r. Upon receipt of this message, r builds an O-reference, with
weight 1.5.
– r deletes its O-reference, and sends a control message to p with weight 1.5.
Upon receipt of this message, p decreases the total weight of O to 3. Since the
partial and total weight of O are now equal, and p holds no O-pointer, O can be
reclaimed by the garbage collector.
Just as with weight-throwing termination detection, a drawback of weighted reference
counting is the possibility of underflow: when the weight of a reference becomes
too small to be divided further, no more duplication is possible. There are two
possible solutions:
1. The reference increases its weight and tells the object owner to increase its total
weight. An acknowledgment from the object owner to the reference is needed
before it can be duplicated, to avoid race conditions.
2. The process at which the underflow occurs creates an artificial object, with a
reference to the original object. Duplicated references are then to the artificial
object, so that references to the original object become indirect.
7.2 Garbage collection implies termination detection
At first sight, garbage collection has little in common with termination detection discussed
in the previous chapter. On the other hand, the garbage collection algorithms
in the previous section may have reminded you of some of the termination detection
algorithms discussed before. This is not a coincidence. It turns out that garbage collection
algorithms can be transformed into (existing and new) termination detection
algorithms. This works as follows.
Given a basic algorithm. Let each process p host one artificial root object Op.
There is also a special nonroot object Z. Initially, only initiators p hold a reference
from Op to Z. Each basic message carries a duplication of the Z-reference. When a
process becomes passive, it deletes its Z-reference. When a process becomes active,
it immediately duplicates a Z-reference, owing to the fact that all basic messages
carry a Z-reference.
The basic algorithm is terminated if and only if Z is garbage. Namely, if all
processes are passive and there are no messages in transit, then clearly there is no
Z-reference. And vice versa, if there is an active process or a message in transit, it
holds (a duplication of) the Z-reference.
7.3 Tracing 51
This transformation turns indirect reference counting into Dijkstra-Scholten termination
detection (see exercise 7.6), and weighted reference counting into a slight
variation of weight-throwing termination detection (see exercise 7.7). Note that examples
7.1 and 7.2 are basically identical to examples 6.1 and 6.3, respectively, but
in the context of garbage collection instead of termination detection.
7.3 Tracing
Tracing (or mark-scan) garbage collection consists of two phases. The first phase
consists of a traversal of all accessible objects, starting from the root objects; the accessible
objects are marked. In the second phase, all unmarked objects are reclaimed.
An advantage of this approach, compared to reference counting, is that it detects
all garbage, including cyclic garbage. A disadvantage is that it tends to require freezing
the basic execution. In spite of this drawback, tracing has become much more
widely used than reference counting, since it has become the method of choice for
garbage collection within Java. A key to this success has been the division of objects
into two generations.
There are two standard ways to perform the second phase of tracing, in which
unmarked objects are reclaimed.
• Mark-copy: copy all marked objects to contiguous empty memory space.
• Mark-compact: compact all marked objects in the current memory space.
Copying is significantly faster than compaction, because marked objects are copied
without changing the memory structure. However, in the long run copying leads to a
fragmentation of the memory space.
In practice, most objects either can be reclaimed shortly after their creation, or
stay accessible for a very long time. This observation is exploited by generational
garbage collection, in which objects are divided into two generations. Garbage in
the young generation is collected frequently using mark-copy, while garbage in the
old generation is collected sporadically using mark-compact. A newly created object
starts in the young generation. If it stays accessible for a certain amount of time (or
for a certain number of garbage collection runs), it is moved from the young to the
old generation.
Bibliographical notes
The technique to detect cyclic garbage mentioned at the start of this chapter originates
from [79]. Indirect reference counting was put forward in [64], and weighted
reference counting was proposed independently in [10] and [80]. The derivation of
termination detection algorithms from garbage collection algorithms is due to [77].
Generational garbage collection stems from [49].
52 7 Garbage Collection
Exercises
Exercise 7.1 Give an example of cyclic garbage where trial deletion of one object
does not help to detect garbage.
Exercise 7.2 Consider the following computation of a basic algorithm on an undirected
ring of size three, with processes p, q, and r, where p owns an object O.
Initially, there is one O-pointer. First, p sends a message to q and r, both containing
a created O-reference. Next, p deletes the O-pointer. At arrival of the message from
p, q and r create an O-reference. Now q and r send a message to each other, both
containing a duplicated O-reference, and delete their O-reference. At arrival of these
messages, q and r create an O-reference again. Finally, q and r both delete their
O-reference.
Explain for each of the following two garbage collection algorithms how it is
detected that O has become garbage.
(a) Indirect reference counting.
(b) Weighted reference counting.
Exercise 7.3 Argue the correctness of indirect as well as weighted reference counting.
Exercise 7.4 In weighted reference counting, why is underflow much more likely to
happen than overflow of a reference counter?
Exercise 7.5 Consider solution 1 for dealing with underflow in weighted reference
counting. Give an example to show that if the process where the weight is increased
would not wait for an acknowledgment from the object owner, then the object owner
could prematurely mark the object as garbage.
Exercise 7.6 Show, using the technique from section 7.2, that indirect reference
counting gives rise to Dijkstra-Scholten termination detection.
Exercise 7.7 Show, using the technique from section 7.2, that weighted reference
counting gives rise to a variation of weight-throwing termination detection, in which
the initiator cannot reuse weight that was returned to it. Also take into account solution
1 in case of underflow.

Routing
When a process wants to send a message to another process in the network that is
not a direct neighbor, the message needs to be routed through the network. Especially
for the Internet, effective routing algorithms are of vital importance. Each process q
maintains a routing table, which stores for each destination p ̸= q the distance of
q to p as well as a neighbor r of q: each message with destination p that arrives
at q is passed on to r. We assume that each channel c is provided with a positive
weight weight(c), and will discuss algorithms that route messages via shortest paths,
meaning that the sum of the weights of the traversed channels is minimal.
8.1 Chandy-Misra algorithm
The Chandy-Misra algorithm is a centralized routing algorithm (also called singlesource
shortest path algorithm) for undirected networks. It computes a sink tree consisting
of shortest paths to the initiator.
Each process p maintains values distp and parentp, where distp is the length
of the shortest known path from p to the initiator, and parentp the process after
p on this path. Initially, the variable dist at the initiator has value 0, distp = ∞ (that is, infinity) for each noninitiator p, and parentp =⊥ (that is, undefined) for all
processes p.
The algorithm starts with messages ⟨dist, 0⟩, which the initiator sends to all its
neighbors, informing them that the initiator knows a path to itself of distance 0.
When a process p receives a message ⟨dist, d⟩ from a neighbor q, it checks
whether d+weight(pq) < distp. If yes, p has found a shorter path to the initiator via
q, so it changes distp into d+weight(pq) and parentp into q, and communicates the
improved estimate to all neighbors except q in the form of a message ⟨dist, distp⟩.
If no, p simply purges the incoming message from q.
A termination detection algorithm has to be used on the side. For instance, one
could employ the Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm (see section 6.1).

Initially, distp = 0 and distq = distr = dists = distt = ∞, while parent =⊥ at
all five processes.
– p sends ⟨dist, 0⟩ to q and r.
– When p’s message arrives at q, distq ← 1
2 and parent q ← p, and q sends
⟨dist, 12
⟩ to r.
– When q’s message arrives at r, distr ← 1 and parent r ← q, and r sends
⟨dist, 1⟩ to p, s and t.
– p purges r’s message.
– When r’s message arrives at s, dists ← 98
and parent s ← r, and s sends
⟨dist, 9
8 ⟩ to t.
– When s’s message arrives at t, distt ← 54
and parent t ← s, and t sends ⟨dist, 54
⟩ to r.
– r purges t’s message.
– When r’s message arrives at t, distt ← 98
and parent t ← r, and t sends ⟨dist, 98
⟩ to s.
– s purges t’s message.
– When p’s message (finally) arrives at r, distr ← 12
and parent r ← p, and r
sends ⟨dist, 12
⟩ to q, s and t.
– q purges r’s message.
– When r’s message arrives at s, dists ← 58
and parent s ← r, and s sends
⟨dist, 5
8 ⟩ to t.
– When s’s message arrives at t, distt ← 34
and parent t ← s, and t sends ⟨dist, 34
⟩ to r.
– r purges t’s message.
– When r’s message arrives at t, distt ← 58
and parent t ← r, and t sends ⟨dist, 58
⟩ to s.
– s purges t’s message.
We argue that the Chandy-Misra algorithm computes shortest paths toward the
initiator. A safety property of the algorithm is that any process p with distp < ∞has
a shortest path to the initiator with weight at most distp. Namely, this property holds
initially, and is an invariant: if p receives a message ⟨dist, d⟩ from a neighbor q, then
there is a path from p via q to the initiator with weight at most d + weight(pq); so
(even) if p changes distp into d + weight(pq), the property is preserved. We now
8.2 Merlin-Segall algorithm 55
reason that for each process p, distp will eventually attain the weight of a shortest
path from p to the initiator, by induction on the number of channels in such a path.
The base case, where p is the initiator, is trivial, because then distp is 0 from the start.
In the inductive case, let a shortest path from p to the initiator start with the channel
pq. By induction, eventually distq will attain the weight of a shortest path from q to
the initiator; this path cannot go via p, because channels carry positive weights. So
q will send ⟨dist, distq⟩ to p, and at reception of this message, distp will equal the
weight of a shortest path from p to the initiator. Finally, if p is a noninitiator, then a
shortest path from p to the initiator goes via parentp, because parentp is updated at
each improvement of distp.
The worst-case message complexity of the Chandy-Misra algorithm is exponential,
since there can be exponentially many different cycle-free paths from a process
to the initiator, which may be discovered in decreasing order of weight (see exercise
8.3). In case of minimum-hop paths in unweighted networks (in other words, each
channel has weight 1), the worst-case message complexity of computing shortest
paths to all processes in the network drops down to O(N2E). Namely, for each process,
the algorithm requires at most O(NE) messages to compute all shortest paths
to this process: the longest cycle-free path has at most length N −1, so each process
sends at most N − 1 messages to its neighbors. In case of minimum-hop paths, the
sink tree forms a breadth-first search tree.
8.2 Merlin-Segall algorithm
The Merlin-Segall algorithm is a centralized algorithm to compute all shortest paths
to the initiator. The underlying idea is to bring structure to the Chandy-Misra algorithm
by letting it proceed in rounds. In each round, distance messages `a la Chandy-
Misra flow up and down the sink tree similar to the echo algorithm, and distance
values are updated. At the end of each round, the sink tree is restructured.
Initially, after round 0, the variable dist at the initiator has value 0, distp = ∞ for each noninitiator p, and the parentp values form a sink tree with the initiator as
root. Such a sink tree can be built by means of a centralized wave algorithm from
chapter 4.
Each round > 0 is started by the initiator, which sends the message ⟨dist, 0⟩ to
its neighbors, to inform them that the initiator has a shortest path to itself of length
0.
Let a noninitiator p receive a message ⟨dist, d⟩ from a neighbor q.
• If d+weight(pq) < distp, then distp ← d+weight(pq) (and p stores q as future
value for parentp).
• If q = parentp, then p sends ⟨dist, distp⟩ to its neighbors except q.
When p has received a message from all its neighbors in the current round, it sends
⟨dist, distp⟩ to parentp, and moves to the next round. If p updated distp in the last
round, then p updates parentp to the neighbor whose message is responsible for the
56 8 Routing
current value of distp. The initiator starts a new round after it has received a message
from all its neighbors in the current round.
After round n ≥ 0, for each process p with a shortest path to the initiator that
consists of ≤ n channels, distp and parentp have achieved their ultimate value. This
is easy to see by induction on n. The base case n = 0is trivial, because at the initiator
the variables dist and parent have value 0 and ⊥ from the start. Now consider the
inductive case: a noninitiator p with a shortest path of ≤ n + 1 channels to the
initiator. Let pq be the first channel in this path. Then process q has a shortest path of
≤ n channels to the initiator. By the induction hypothesis, after round n, distq has
obtained its ultimate value. So in round n + 1, p receives the message ⟨dist, distq⟩ from q. Therefore, distp and parentp have achieved their ultimate values at the end
of round n + 1. Since shortest paths consist of at most N − 1 channels, the Merlin-
Segall algorithm can terminate after round N − 1.
Example 8.2 We consider one possible computation of the Merlin-Segall algorithm
on the following undirected network. The original sink tree, after round 0, consists
of edges qr, rp, and sp.

The computation determines the correct sink tree toward the initiator p only at the
end of round 3, because (1) there is a shortest path of length three, (2) we start with a
sink tree that has nothing in common with the correct sink tree, and (3) every round
we let messages in the opposite direction of the sink tree travel very fast, so that
processes send messages to their neighbors early on.
The five pictures below show one possible progression of round 1. Process names
and channel weights are omitted from these pictures. Messages that are depicted with
a solid arrow head are toward a parent. In the first picture, p has sent out messages
⟨dist, 0⟩. In the second picture, r and s have received this message from their parent
p, computed distances 5 and 4, and sent ⟨dist, 5⟩ and ⟨dist, 4⟩, respectively, to
their other neighbors. In the third picture, q has received ⟨dist, 5⟩ from its parent r,
computed distance 8, and sent ⟨dist, 8⟩ to its other neighbors. In the fourth picture, s
has received ⟨dist, 8⟩ from q and ⟨dist, 5⟩ from r, sent ⟨dist, 4⟩ to its parent p, and
made p its parent (again); moreover, q has received ⟨dist, 0⟩ from p and ⟨dist, 4⟩ from s, computed an improved distance 1, sent ⟨dist, 1⟩ to its parent r, and made p
its new parent. In the fifth picture, r has received ⟨dist, 1⟩ from q and ⟨dist, 4⟩ from
s, computed an improved distance 4, sent ⟨dist, 4⟩ to its parent p, and made q its new
parent. When the three messages traveling toward p have reached their destination,
round 2 is started.

Now the computation has terminated. In the terminal configuration, the correct shortest
paths toward p have been computed, leading from r to s to q to p.
The message complexity of the Merlin-Segall algorithm is Θ(N2E). Namely,
for each root, the algorithm requires (N − 1)2E messages: in N − 1 rounds, two
messages travel through each channel.
The Merlin-Segall algorithm can be adapted to make it robust against topology
changes. When a channel fails or becomes operational, the adjacent processes send
a special control message toward the initiator via the sink tree. If the failed channel
happens to be a tree edge, then the remaining tree is extended to a complete sink tree
toward the initiator again. If the special control message meets a failed tree edge,
it is discarded. This is no problem, because the other side of this tree edge already
sends a control message toward the initiator. When the initiator receives this control
message, it starts a new set of N rounds, with a higher number. This number is
attached to the messages in this run of the algorithm.
8.3 Toueg’s algorithm
Toueg’s algorithm is a decentralized algorithm that generalizes the well-known
Floyd-Warshall algorithm to a distributed setting. It is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm,
meaning that it computes a shortest path between any pair of processes. The
idea behind the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is to compute, for each set S of processes,
a distance function dS(p, q), denoting the length of a shortest path between p and q
with all intermediate processes in S. The following equations hold:
8.3 Toueg’s algorithm 59
dS(p, p) = 0.
d∅(p, q) = weight(pq) if p ̸= q and there is a channel pq.
d∅(p, q) = ∞if p ̸= q and there is no channel pq.
dS∪{r}(p, q) = min{dS(p, r) + dS(r, q), dS(p, q)} for each r ̸∈ S.
The first equation is obvious. For the second and third equations, note that if S = ∅,
then a path between two distinct processes p and q with all intermediate processes
in S can only consist of a channel between p and q. The fourth equation expresses
that a shortest path between p and q with all intermediate processes in S ∪{r} either
visits r or does not; in the first case this path has length dS(p, r) + dS(r, q), and in
the second case it has length dS(p, q).
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm starts with S = ∅, in which case the first three
equations completely define dS. As long as S does not contain all processes, a socalled
pivot r ̸∈ S is selected, and dS∪{r} is computed from dS using the fourth
equation; then r is added to S. Finally, note that if S contains all processes, then dS
is the standard distance function.
Transferring this algorithm to a distributed setting gives rise to two complications.
First, all processes must uniformly select the pivots in the same order. Therefore,
we make the (strong) assumption that each process knows from the start the
IDs of all processes in the network. Second, in each pivot round, the pivot r must
broadcast its routing table, because a process p may need to know dS(r, q) in order
to compute dS∪{r}(p, q).
In Toueg’s algorithm, each process p starts with Sp = ∅, and maintains values
distp(q) and parentp(q) for each process q, where distp(q) is the length of
the shortest known path from p to q, and parentp(q) the process after p on this
path. Initially, distp(p) = 0 and parentp(p) =⊥, while for each q ̸= p, either
distp(q) = weight(pq) and parentp(q) = q if there is a channel pq, or distp(q) = ∞ and parentp(q) =⊥ otherwise.
In each successive round, the same pivot r is selected by all processes, and
added to all sets Sp. The pivot r broadcasts its values distr(q) for all processes
q. If parentp(r) =⊥ for a process p ̸= r in this pivot round, then distp(r) = ∞,
so distp(r) + distr(q) ≥ distp(q) for all processes q. Therefore, processes that are
not in the sink tree toward r do not need the routing table of r. Hence, this sink tree
can be used in the opposite direction to broadcast distr. To facilitate this use of r’s
sink tree, in the r-pivot round, each process p sends ⟨request, r⟩ to parentp(r) if it
is not ⊥, to let it pass on the values distr(q) to p. Next, p acts as follows.
– If p is not in the sink tree of r, then p immediately completes the r-pivot round.
– Suppose p is in the sink tree of r (that is, parentp(r) ̸=⊥ or p = r). If p ̸= r,
then p waits until it has received the values distr(q) from parentp(r). It forwards
these values to the neighbors that send ⟨request, r⟩ to p. Moreover, p checks
for each process q whether distp(r) + distr(q) < distp(q), and if so, performs
distp(q) ← distp(r) + distr(q) and parentp(q) ← parentp(r).
60 8 Routing
After completing the r-pivot round, p performs Sp ← Sp ∪ {r}. Finally, p either
proceeds to the next pivot round, if Sp does not contain all processes, or terminates
otherwise.
Example 8.3 We give a computation of Toueg’s algorithm on the following network,
with pivot order p q r s.
p
s
q
r
1
1 1

Initially, distt(t) = 0 for all four processes t, distt(u) = weight(tu) if there is a
channel tu, and all other dist values are ∞. And parent t(u) = u if t is a direct
neighbor of u, and all other parent values are ⊥.
In the p-pivot round, q and s both send ⟨request, p⟩ to p. So the distance values
of p are sent to q and s, but not to r, which is not yet in the sink tree of p. As a result,
q and s discover a path to each other via p, so that distq(s) and dists(q) are set to 5,
and parent q(s) and parent s(q) to p.
In the q-pivot round, p, r, and s send ⟨request, q⟩ to q, q, and p, respectively.
So the distance values of q are sent to p, r, and s. As a result, p and r discover a path
to each other via q, so that distp(r) and distr(p) are set to 5, and parentp(r) and
parent r(p) to q.
In the r-pivot round, p, q, and s send ⟨request, r⟩ to q, r, and r, respectively. So
the distance values of r are sent to p, q, and s. As a result, q and s discover a shorter
path to each other via r, so that distq(s) and dists(q) are set to 2, and parent q(s)
and parent s(q) to r.
In the s-pivot round, p, q, and r send ⟨request, x⟩ to s, r, and s, respectively. So
the distance values of s are sent to p, q, and r. As a result, p and r discover a shorter
path to each other via s, so that distp(r) and distr(p) are set to 2, and parentp(r)
and parent r(p) to s. Moreover, p and q discover a shorter path to each other via s,
so that distp(q) and distq(p) are set to 3, parentp(q) to s, and parent q(p) to r.
The worst-case message complexity of Toueg’s algorithm is O(NE): there are
N pivot rounds, and each round takes O(E) messages.
By adding messages to inform neighbors that no distance values for the current
round need to be forwarded (so negative counterparts of request messages), it can
be avoided that processes need to store distance values of pivots from past rounds
indefinitely.
A drawback of Toueg’s algorithm (next to uniform selection of pivots) is that all
distance values of a pivot are sent through the sink tree of the pivot, which gives rise
to a high bit complexity. This overhead can be reduced as follows. When a process
p in the sink tree of the pivot r receives the distance values of r, it first performs
for each process q the check whether distp(r) + distr(q) < distp(q). Now p only
8.4 Frederickson’s algorithm 61
needs to forward those values distr(q) for which this check yields a positive result
(see exercise 8.9).
8.4 Frederickson’s algorithm
We now discuss a centralized algorithm to compute a breadth-first search tree toward
the initiator, in an undirected (unweighted) network. We first consider a simple
version of this algorithm, in which the processes at distance n from the initiator are
discovered in round n.
Initially (after round 0), the variable dist at the initiator has value 0, distp = ∞ for each noninitiator p, and parentp =⊥ for all processes p. After each round n ≥ 0,
the breadth-first search tree has been constructed up to depth n: for each process p at
a distance k ≤ n from the initiator, distp = k, and p knows which neighbors are at
distance k − 1; and if p is a noninitiator, then it has a parent in the sink tree toward
the initiator.
We explain what happens in round n + 1. It can be depicted as follows:
n
0
explore
explore
explore/reverse
forward/reverse
forward/reverse
n + 1
At the start of the round, messages ⟨forward, n⟩ travel down the tree, from the
initiator to processes at depth n. When a process p at depth n receives this message,
it sends ⟨explore, n + 1⟩ to its neighbors that are not at depth n − 1. When such a
neighbor q receives this message, it acts as follows, depending on whether distq is
∞, n + 1, or n:
• If distq = ∞, then distq ← n + 1, parent q ← p, and q sends back
⟨reverse, true⟩, informing p that q is a child of p.
• If distq = n+1, then q stores that p is at depth n and sends back ⟨reverse, false⟩,
informing p that q is not a child of p.
• If distq = n, then q interprets ⟨explore, n+1⟩ as a negative reply to the message
⟨explore, n + 1⟩ that q sent (or will send) to p.
A process p at depth n waits until all messages ⟨explore, n+1⟩ have been answered
with a ⟨reverse, ⟩ or ⟨explore, n + 1⟩. Likewise, a noninitiator p at a depth < n
waits until all messages ⟨forward, n⟩ have been answered with a ⟨reverse, ⟩. In
both cases p sends ⟨reverse, b⟩ to its parent, where b = true only if new processes
were added to its subtree.
62 8 Routing
The initiator waits until all messages ⟨forward, n⟩ (or, in case of round 1,
⟨explore, 1⟩) have been answered with a ⟨reverse, ⟩. If no new processes were
added in round n + 1, then the initiator terminates, and it may inform all other processes
that the breadth-first search has terminated. Otherwise, the initiator continues
with round n+2; processes in the tree only send a forward to children that reported
new processes in round n + 1.
The worst-case message complexity of this breadth-first search algorithm is
O(N2). Namely, there are at most N +1 rounds, and in each round tree edges carry
at most one forward and one replying reverse, adding up to at most 2(N − 1)N
messages. And in total, channels carry one explore and one replying reverse
or explore, adding up to 2E messages. The worst-case time complexity is also
O(N2): round n is completed in at most 2n time units, for n = 1, . . . , N, and
2(1 + 2 + · · · + N) = N(N + 1).
The idea behind Frederickson’s algorithm is that in the breadth-first search algorithm
described earlier, forward messages need to travel up and down the tree often,
as each round only discovers processes that are one level deeper than the ones discovered
in the previous round. Efficiency can be gained by exploring several levels
in one round. However, explore messages then give a performance penalty, because
they may travel through the same channel multiple times in one round. Notably, if
we abolished forward messages and used only explore messages to discover all
processes in one round, we would be back at the Chandy-Misra algorithm, which we
have seen is not efficient. Therefore, the number of levels explored in one round is
included as a parameter ℓ. At the end, an optimal value for ℓ will be determined.
Initially (after round 0), the variable dist at the initiator has value 0, distp = ∞ for each noninitiator p, and parentp =⊥ for all processes p. After each round n ≥ 0,
the breadth-first search tree has been constructed up to depth ℓn: for each process p
at a distance k ≤ ℓn from the initiator, distp = k, and p knows which neighbors are
at distance k−1; and if p is a noninitiator, then it has a parent in the sink tree toward
the initiator.
At the start of round n + 1, messages ⟨forward, ℓn⟩ travel down the tree, from
the initiator to processes at depth ℓn. When a process at depth ℓn receives this message,
it sends ⟨explore, ℓn + 1⟩ to its neighbors that are not at depth ℓn − 1. The
parameter in this message is (an overapproximation of) the depth of the receiving
process; this value is increased by one every time the message is forwarded. When
this parameter becomes divisible by ℓ, the ℓ levels for the current round have been
explored.
Compared to the simple breadth-first search algorithm discussed before, there
are two complications. First, a process q may receive a forward from a neighbor
p that is not its parent. This can happen if in the previous round p temporarily was
q’s parent, but q later selected another parent with a shorter path to the initiator, and
p sent the forward to q before being informed that q is no longer its child (see
exercise 8.13). Such a forward can simply be purged by q. Second, a process may
send multiple explores into a channel, if its distance value is improved several times
in one round. Therefore, reverses in reply to explores are supplied with a distance
8.4 Frederickson’s algorithm 63
parameter, so that a process can distinguish to which explore an incoming reverse
is a reply.
Let a process q receive a message ⟨explore, k⟩ from a neighbor p. We consider
two cases.
• k < distq.
Then distq ← k and parent q ← p.
∗ If k is not divisible by ℓ, then q sends ⟨explore, k + 1⟩ to its neighbors except
p. Next, q waits until it has received ⟨reverse, k + 1, ⟩ or ⟨explore, j⟩ with
j ∈ {k, k +1, k +2} from all these neighbors. Then q sends ⟨reverse, k, true⟩ to p. Only neighbors that reply with ⟨reverse, k + 1, true⟩ are children of q in
the tree. (Unless q also receives a message ⟨explore, k⟩ from such a neighbor,
in which case the sender is not a child of q.)
If, later, q receives a message ⟨explore, k′⟩ with k′ < k, then q changes its
distance to k′, makes the sender its parent, sends messages ⟨explore, k′ + 1⟩,
and waits for replies to these messages before sending ⟨reverse, k′, true⟩ to its
new parent.
∗ If k is divisible by ℓ, then q sends ⟨reverse, k, true⟩ to p immediately.
• k ≥ distq.
∗ If k is not divisible by ℓ, then q does not send a reply to p. In this case q sent
⟨explore, distq + 1⟩ into this channel, which already serves as a negative acknowledgment
to the current incoming message.
∗ If k is divisible by ℓ, then q sends ⟨reverse, k, false⟩ to p.
A process p at depth ℓn waits until all messages ⟨explore, ℓn + 1⟩ have been answered
with a reverse or explore. Likewise, a noninitiator p at a depth < ℓn waits
until all messages ⟨forward, ℓn⟩ have been answered with a reverse. In both cases
p sends ⟨reverse, b⟩ to its parent, where b = true only if new processes were added
to its subtree.
The initiator waits until all messages ⟨forward, ℓn⟩ (or, in case of round 1,
⟨explore, 1⟩) have been answered with a reverse. If no new processes were added
in round n + 1, then the initiator terminates and may inform all other processes that
the breadth-first search has terminated. Otherwise, the initiator continues with round
n + 2; processes in the tree only send a forward to children that reported new
processes in round n + 1.
Example 8.4 We consider one possible computation of Frederickson’s algorithm on
the following network, with p as initiator, and ℓ = 3.
s
r t
q
p u
64 8 Routing
After round 0, distp = 0, and the distance value of all other processes is∞; nobody
has a parent.
– Round 1 is started by p, who sends ⟨explore, 1⟩ to q and r.
– p’s explore arrives at q: distq ← 1, parent q ← p, and q sends ⟨explore, 2⟩ to
r and s.
– q’s explore arrives at r: distr ← 2, parent r ← q, and r sends ⟨explore, 3⟩ to
p, s and t.
– p purges r’s explore.
– r’s explore arrives at s: dists ← 3, parent s ← r, and s sends ⟨reverse, 3, true⟩ in reply.
– r’s explore arrives at t: distt ← 3, parent t ← r, and t sends ⟨reverse, 3, true⟩ in reply.
– p’s explore arrives at r: distr ← 1, parent r ← p, and r sends ⟨explore, 2⟩ to
q, s and t.
– r purges the reverses from s and t.
– q’s explore arrives at s: dists ← 2, parent s ← q, and s sends ⟨explore, 3⟩ to
r, t, and u.
– r’s explore arrives at t: distt ← 2, and t sends ⟨explore, 3⟩ to s and u.
– s’s explore arrives at u: distu ← 3, parentu ← s, and u sends back
⟨reverse, 3, true⟩.
– t’s explore arrives at u, who sends back ⟨reverse, 3, false⟩.
– r’s and t’s explore and u’s reverse arrive at s, who sends ⟨reverse, 2, true⟩ to q.
– s’s explore and u’s reverse arrive at t, who sends ⟨reverse, 2, true⟩ to r.
– r’s explore and s’s reverse arrive at q, who sends ⟨reverse, 1, true⟩ to p.
– s’s explore and t’s reverse arrive at r, who sends ⟨reverse, 1, true⟩ to p.
– q’s and r’s reverse arrive at p, who starts round 2; no further processes are
discovered, after which the computation terminates.
The resulting spanning tree is as follows.
s
r t
q
p u
The worst-case message complexity of Frederickson’s algorithm, where ℓ levels
are explored in each round, is O(⌈N
ℓ ⌉N + ℓE). Namely, there are at most ⌈N
ℓ ⌉ + 1
rounds, and in each round, tree edges carry at most one forward and one replying
reverse, adding up to at most 2⌈N
ℓ ⌉(N −1) messages. And in total, channels carry
at most 2ℓ explores and 2ℓ replying reverses, and frond edges carry at most one
spurious forward, adding up to (fewer than) (4ℓ + 1)E messages.
8.5 Packet switching 65
The worst-case time complexity of Frederickson’s algorithm is O(ℓ⌈N
ℓ ⌉2): round
n is completed in at most 2ℓn time units, for n = 0, . . . , ⌈N
ℓ ⌉, and 2ℓ(1 + 2 + · · · +
⌈N
ℓ ⌉) = ℓ⌈N
ℓ ⌉(⌈N
ℓ ⌉ + 1).
If we take ℓ = ⌈ N √E ⌉, then both the worst-case message and time complexity
are O(N√E). So computing a breadth-first search tree toward each process in the
network takes O(N2√E) messages and time in the worst case.
8.5 Packet switching
Consider a network in which routing tables have been computed, so that all processes
know how data packets should be forwarded through the network to their destinations.
On their way, these packets are stored at a buffer slot of a process, until that
process is certain the packet has been stored safely in the buffer of the next process
on the packet’s route. When a packet reaches its destination it is consumed, that is,
removed from the network.
Even with cycle-free routing tables, a store-and-forward deadlock may occur,
when a group of packets are all waiting for the use of a buffer slot occupied by a
packet in the group. A controller avoids such deadlocks, by prescribing whether a
new packet can be generated at a process, or an existing packet can be forwarded
to the next process, and possibly in which buffer slot it is put. To avoid a trivial
deadlock-free controller that disallows any generation of packets, it is required that
generation of a new packet at a process with an empty buffer should always be allowed.
As we said, a process can eliminate a packet from its buffer only when it is
sure the packet has arrived safely at the next process. For simplicity, we assume
synchronous communication, which basically means that a process can send a packet
only when the receiver is ready to receive it. That is, we abstract away from the
communication overhead imposed by fruitless attempts to forward a packet.
Destination and hops-so-far controllers
Consider a directed network of processes p0, . . . , pN−1, and let Ti be the sink tree
(with respect to the routing tables) with root pi for i = 0, . . . , N −1.We discuss two
controllers based on these sink trees.
In the destination controller, each process carries N buffer slots, numbered from
0 to N − 1. The ith buffer slots at the processes are used to mimic the sink tree Ti.
• When a packet with destination pi is generated at a process q, it is placed in the
ith buffer slot of q.
• If qr is an edge in Ti, then a packet in the ith buffer slot of q can be forwarded to
the ith buffer slot of r.
The destination controller is deadlock-free. This follows from the fact that, for
each i, since Ti is acyclic, packets in the ith buffer slot of any process can always
travel to their destination.
66 8 Routing
Let K be the length of a longest path in any Ti. In the hops-so-far controller,
each process carries K + 1 buffer slots, numbered from 0 to K.
• When a packet is generated at a process q, it is placed in the 0th buffer slot of q.
• If qr is an edge in some Ti, then for any j <K, a packet in the jth buffer slot of
q can be forwarded to the (j + 1)th buffer slot of r.
We argue that the hops-so-far controller is deadlock-free. It is easy to see, by
induction on j, that no packet can get stuck at a (K −j)th buffer slot of any process,
for j = 0, . . . , K. The base case j = 0 is trivial, because a packet in a Kth buffer
slot is guaranteed to be at its destination, and so can be consumed. Now consider the
inductive case: a packet in a (K − (j + 1))th buffer slot. By induction, packets in
a (K − j)th buffer slot can be forwarded to their destination and consumed. Hence,
a packet in a (K − (j + 1))th buffer slot can either be consumed or forwarded to a
(K − j)th buffer slot and from there to its destination where it is consumed.
Acyclic orientation cover controller
An acyclic orientation of an undirected network G is a directed, acyclic network,
obtained by directing all the edges of G. Acyclic orientations G0, . . . , Gn−1 of G
form an acyclic orientation cover of a set P of paths in G if each path in P is the
concatenation of paths P0, . . . , Pn−1 in G0, . . . , Gn−1, respectively.
Example 8.5 For each undirected ring there exists a cover, consisting of three
acyclic orientations, of the collection of minimum-hop paths. For instance, in case
of a ring of size six:
G0 G1 G2
Given an undirected network G, and an acyclic orientation cover G0, . . . , Gn−1
of a set P of paths in G. In the acyclic orientation cover controller, each process has
n buffer slots, numbered from 0 to n − 1.
• A packet generated at a process q is placed in the 0th buffer slot of q.
• Let qr be an edge in Gi. For any i, a packet in the ith buffer slot of q can be
forwarded to the ith buffer slot of r. Moreover, if i < n − 1, then a packet in the
ith buffer slot of r can be forwarded to the (i + 1)th buffer slot of q.
If all packets are routed via paths in P, then the acyclic orientation cover controller
is deadlock-free. Namely, consider a reachable configuration γ. Forward and
8.6 Routing on the Internet 67
consume packets until a configuration δ is reached where no forwarding or consumption
is possible anymore. We argue by induction on j that in δ each (n − j)th
buffer slot of any process is empty, for j = 1, . . . , n. In the base case j = 1, consider
a packet that is being routed via a concatenation of paths P0, . . . , Pn−1 in
G0, . . . , Gn−1. It is not hard to see that when this packet is in a kth buffer slot, it
is being routed via a Pℓ with ℓ ≥ k. This implies that any packet in an (n − 1)th
buffer slot is being routed via Gn−1. Since Gn−1 is acyclic, packets in an (n − 1)th
buffer slot can travel to their destination. Now consider the inductive case: a packet
in an (n − (j + 1))th buffer slot. By induction, in δ all (n − j)th buffer slots are
empty. Hence, packets in (n − (j + 1))th buffer slots can be consumed, forwarded
via Gn−(j+1) since it is acyclic, or forwarded to an (n − j)th buffer slot since these
are empty. To conclude, in δ all buffer slots are empty.
Example 8.6 For each undirected ring there exists a deadlock-free controller that
uses three buffer slots per process and allows packets to travel via minimum-hop
paths. This follows from the fact that, according to example 8.5, undirected rings
have a cover of the collection of minimum-hop paths that consists of three acyclic
orientations. So the resulting acyclic orientation cover controller requires three buffer
slots per process.
8.6 Routing on the Internet
The routing approaches discussed so far were not designed to cope with large-sized
and dynamic networks. Link-state routing is a pragmatic routing algorithm that has
been geared to the Internet.
Each process periodically (and after a network change) sends a link-state packet
to its neighbors, reporting the channels between the process and its direct neighbors,
as well as their weights (typically based on latency or bandwidth). Moreover, it attaches
a sequence number to these link-state packets, which is increased every time
it broadcasts link-state packets to its neighbors. The link-state packets are flooded
through the network, and all processes store their content, so that they obtain a local
view of the entire network. Processes also store the sequence numbers of link-state
packets on which their local view is based, to avoid that new information is overwritten
by old information. With its local view, a process can locally compute shortest
paths using a uniprocessor algorithm (mostly Dijkstra’s algorithm).
The crash failure and subsequent recovery of a process are eventually detected,
and taken into account in the link-state packets broadcast, by its neighbors. When a
process recovers from a crash, its sequence number restarts at zero, so that the linkstate
packets it broadcasts after the crash might be ignored by the other processes
for a long time. Therefore, link-state packets carry a time-to-live field, defining the
moment in time after which the packet becomes stale and may be discarded. To
reduce the overhead of flooding, each time a link-state packet is forwarded, its timeto-
live field is decreased; when it becomes zero, the packet is discarded.
68 8 Routing
Link-state routing deals well with dynamicity, but does not scale up to the size
of the Internet, because it uses flooding. Therefore, the Internet is divided into socalled
autonomous systems, each of which uses link-state routing (notably by means
of the OSPF Protocol). Routing between autonomous systems is performed with the
Border Gateway Protocol, in which peer routers exchange reachability information,
meaning that a router informs its neighbors about updates in its routing table, either
because it noticed a topology change, or as a result of an update in the routing table
of one of its neighbors. Thus each router maintains an up-to-date routing table based
on autonomous system connectivity. When a router connects to the network for the
first time, other routers provide it with their entire routing table.
To control congestion in the network, in the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP), processes maintain a congestion window for each of its channels. Packets
are acknowledged by the receiver, and the congestion window of a channel provides
an upper bound on the number of unacknowledged packets a process is allowed to
have sent into this channel. The congestion window grows linearly with each received
acknowledgment, up to some threshold. The congestion window may effectively
double in size during every round trip time (that is, the time between sending
a packet and receiving the corresponding acknowledgment), if all packets are being
acknowledged. The congestion window is reset to the initial size (in TCP Tahoe) or
halved (in TCP Reno) with each lost data packet.
Bibliographical notes
The Chandy-Misra algorithm originates from [17], the Merlin-Segall algorithm from
[60], Toueg’s algorithm from [78], and Frederickson’s algorithm from [34] (where
the algorithm is only sketched). The destination and hops-so-far controllers were
proposed in [59] and the acyclic orientation cover controller in [76]. The mechanisms
underlying link-state routing were put forward in [56], and a first version of link-state
routing was used in ARPANET [57]. Congestion windows can be traced back to [40].

Election
In an election algorithm, the processes in the network elect one process among them
as their leader. The aim is usually to let the leader act as the organizer of some
distributed task, as the root of a spanning tree of the network, or as the initiator of a
centralized algorithm. Each computation must start in a configuration in which the
processes are unaware which process will serve as the leader and must terminate in
a configuration where exactly one process is the leader.
Election algorithms are decentralized: the initiators can be any nonempty set of
processes.We require that all processes have the same local algorithm. This disallows
the trivial solution where exactly one process has the algorithm “I am the leader.”
Process IDs are unique and from a totally ordered set. In chapter 10 we will see that
unique IDs are essential to construct election algorithms that always terminate.
9.1 Election in rings
We first consider three election algorithms for ring topologies. In each of these algorithms,
the initiators determine among themselves which one has the highest ID. This
initiator becomes the leader. Initially, the initiators are active, while all noninitiators
are passive. Passive processes are out of the race to become the leader and simply
pass on messages.
Chang-Roberts algorithm
The Chang-Roberts algorithm targets a directed ring. Since networks are assumed
to be strongly connected, a directed ring is oriented either in a clockwise or in a
counterclockwise fashion.
Initially, the initiators send a message to the next process in the ring, tagged with
their ID. When an active process p receives a message tagged with q, there are three
cases.
• q < p: then p purges the message.
• q > p: then p becomes passive, and passes on the message.
74 9 Election
• q = p: then p becomes the leader.
The idea behind the Chang-Roberts algorithm is that only the message with the
highest ID will complete the round trip, because every other message is stopped
at the latest when it arrives at the initiator with the highest ID (by the first case).
Moreover, initiators that do not have the highest ID are made passive at the latest
when they receive the message with the highest ID (by the second case). When an
initiator receives back its own message, it knows it is the leader (by the third case).
Example 9.1 In the ring below, all processes are initiators. If the ring is directed
counterclockwise, then it takes 12
N(N + 1) messages to elect process N − 1 as the
leader. Namely, each message is stopped at process N − 1, so the message from
process i travels i+1 hops for i = 0, . . . , N −1; and 1+2+· · ·+N = 1
2N(N +1).
· · ·
1
N−2
N−1
0
2
If the ring is directed clockwise, then it takes only 2N − 1 messages to elect
process N − 1 as the leader. Namely, each message is stopped after one hop, except
for the message from process N − 1, which travels N hops.
The preceding example shows that the worst-case message complexity of the
Chang-Roberts algorithm is O(N2). It can be shown, however, that the average-case
message complexity is O(N logN).
Franklin’s algorithm
Franklin’s algorithm, which requires an undirected ring, improves upon the worstcase
message complexity of the Chang-Roberts algorithm. In an election round, each
active process p compares its own ID with the IDs of its nearest active neighbors on
both sides. If p’s ID is the largest of the three IDs, then p proceeds to the next election
round. If one of the other IDs is larger than p’s ID, then p becomes passive. And if p
receives its own ID from either side, then it becomes the leader, because there are no
other active processes left in the ring.
To be more precise, at the start of an election round, each active process sends its
ID to its neighbors on either side. When an active process p has received messages
tagged with q and r from either side, there are three cases:
9.1 Election in rings 75
• max{q, r} < p: then p enters another election round by sending its ID in both
directions again.
• max{q, r} > p: then p becomes passive.
• max{q, r} = p: then p becomes the leader.
Since a message can overtake another message from the previous round, processes
need to keep track of the parity of their current round number and must attach
this parity to the message containing their ID; see the pseudocode of the Dolev-
Klawe-Rodeh algorithm in the appendix.
Example 9.2 On the undirected version of the ring in example 9.1, Franklin’s algorithm
terminates in two rounds. In the first round, only process N −1 remains active.
In the second round, process N − 1 finds that it is the leader.
Example 9.3 We run Franklin’s algorithm on the following ring, in which all processes
are initiators.
0 2
5 3
4
1
– Processes 3, 4, and 5 progress to the second election round, because their IDs are
larger than their (active) neighbors. Processes 0, 1, and 2 become passive in the
first round.
– Only process 5 progresses to the third round, because in the second round it finds
that its ID is larger than its nearest active neighbors 3 and 4. Process 3 and 4
become passive in the second round, because their nearest active neighbor 5 has
a larger ID.
– Finally, in the third round, process 5 finds that it is the leader, because the two
messages it sends in either direction complete the round trip.
The worst-case message complexity of Franklin’s algorithm is O(N logN).
Namely, in each round with two or more active processes, at least half of the active
processes become passive, because for each pair of nearest active neighbors at
least one becomes passive. In the final round, the remaining active process becomes
the leader. So there are at most ⌊log2 N⌋ + 1 rounds. And each round takes 2N
messages (two messages per channel).
Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm
The Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm transposes the idea behind Franklin’s algorithm
to a directed ring. In that setting, messages cannot travel in both directions, so that
76 9 Election
an active process cannot easily compare its own ID p with the IDs q and r of its
nearest active neighbors. This is resolved by performing this comparison not at p,
but at its next (in the direction of the ring) active neighbor r. That is, the IDs p and q
are collected at r. If p is larger than q and r, then r remains active, and progresses to
the next election round, in which it assumes the ID p. If p is smaller than q or r, then
r becomes passive. And if p equals q and r, then r becomes the leader. If we really
want the initiator with the largest ID to become the leader, then in the last case, r
could send a special leader message tagged with its last ID around the ring, to inform
the initiator that started the election with this ID that it is the leader.
To be more precise, at the start of an election round, each active process sends
its ID to its next neighbor, with a 0 attached. When an active process r receives this
message ⟨id, p, 0⟩, it stores the ID p and passes on the message with a 1 attached.
And when r receives a message ⟨id, q, 1⟩, it stores the ID q. Now there are three
cases:
• max{q, r} < p: then r enters another round with the new ID p by sending
⟨id, p, 0⟩.
• max{q, r} > p: then r becomes passive.
• max{q, r} = p: then r becomes the leader (or sends a special leader message
tagged with r).
Since a message can overtake another message from the previous round, processes
need to keep track of the parity of their current round number and must attach
this parity to the message containing their ID; see the pseudocode in the appendix.
Example 9.4 Just as Franklin’s algorithm, the Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm takes
just two rounds to terminate on the undirected version of the ring in example 9.1.
This example shows that an active process r that collects IDs p and q in an election
round, must really act as if it is the middle process p. If r proceeded to the next
round if its own ID were the largest, then it is easy to see that the message complexity
of the Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm on the ring in example 9.1 would become
O(N2).
Example 9.5 We run the Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm on the ring in example 9.3,
oriented in the clockwise direction.
– Processes 0, 1, and 2 progress to the second election round, because they act as
processes 5, 3, and 4, respectively. For instance, process 0 collects the IDs 5 (with
a 0 attached) and 1 (with a 1 attached); concludes that 5 is the largest ID of 0, 5,
and 1; and progresses to the second round with the ID 5. Likewise for processes
1 and 2. Processes 3, 4, and 5 become passive in the first round, because they act
as processes 2, 0, and 1, respectively.
– Only process 2 (which assumed the ID 4 for the second round) progresses to the
third round, because in the second round it collects the IDs 5 (with a 0 attached)
and 3 (with a 1 attached), and concludes that 5 is the largest ID of 4, 5, and 3.
Process 0 (which assumed the ID 5) and 1 (which assumed the ID 3) become
passive in the second round.
9.2 Tree election algorithm 77
– Finally, in the third round, process 2 (which assumed the ID 5 for the third round)
finds that it is the leader, because it receives back its own ID, first with a 0 attached
and next with a 1 attached. Alternatively, process 2 can announce to the
other processes that 5 is the largest ID in the ring, after which the process that
carried the ID 5 at the start of the election becomes the leader.
The worst-case message complexity of the Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm is the
same as of Franklin’s algorithm: O(N logN). Namely, there are at most ⌊log2 N⌋+1
rounds, and each round takes 2N messages.
It can be shown that Ω(N logN) is a lower bound on the average-case message
complexity of any election algorithm for rings.
9.2 Tree election algorithm
The tree algorithm from section 4.2 can be used as the basis for an election algorithm
in acyclic undirected networks. The idea is that each process p collects IDs from its
children, computes the maximum of these IDs and its own ID, and passes on this
maximum to its parent. Later, p receives the overall maximum of the IDs in the
network from its parent, which p passes on to its children.
In election algorithms the initiators can be any nonempty set of processes, while
the tree algorithm starts from all the leaves in the network. Therefore, the tree election
algorithm is booted by a wake-up phase, driven by the initiators, which send a
wake-up message to all their neighbors. These wake-up messages are then flooded
through the network; that is, noninitiators send a wake-up message to their neighbors
after they have received a first wake-up message. A process wakes up when it has
received wake-up messages from all its neighbors.
The local algorithm at an awake process p is as follows:
• p waits until it has received IDs from all its neighbors except one, which becomes
its parent.
• p computes the largest ID maxp among the received IDs and its own ID.
• p sends a parent message to its parent, tagged with maxp.
• If p receives a parent message from its parent, tagged with q, then it computes
max′p, being the maximum of maxp and q.
• Next, p sends an information message to all neighbors except its parent, tagged
with max′p.
Each node that receives the information message, tagged with the largest ID in the
network, forwards it to its children. Thus the information message is forwarded
through the entire network, and eventually the process with the largest ID becomes
the leader.
The only tricky part of the algorithm is that if p receives a parent message, tagged
with an ID q, from its parent r, then p must compare the ID q with the maximum
maxp it computed before. The reason is that p and r computed the maximum among
all IDs in disjoint parts of the network, which together cover the entire network.

and calculated the maximum 6, concluding that 6 must become the leader; process 3
has moreover sent 6 to its two children.

In the fifth picture, processes 1 and 6 have received the message from 3; process 6

two messages have arrived, the algorithm has terminated.
Just as the tree algorithm, the tree election algorithm takes 2N −2 messages: two
messages per channel. And the wake-up phase also takes 2N − 2 messages.
9.3 Echo algorithm with extinction 79
9.3 Echo algorithm with extinction
We now discuss an election algorithm for undirected networks that works for any
topology. The idea is to let each initiator start a run of the echo algorithm from
section 4.3, tagged with its ID. Only the wave started by the initiator with the largest
ID completes, after which this initiator becomes the leader. Noninitiators join the
first wave that hits them.
At any time, each process takes part in at most one wave. Suppose a process p
that is participating in a wave tagged with q is hit by a wave tagged with r.
• If q < r, then p makes the sender its parent, changes to the wave tagged with r
(it abandons all the wave messages it received earlier), and treats the incoming
message accordingly.
• If q > r, then p continues with the wave tagged with q (it purges the incoming
message).
• If q = r, then p treats the incoming message according to the echo algorithm of
the wave tagged with q.
If the wave tagged with p completes, by executing a decide event at p, then p becomes
the leader.
Waves of initiators that do not have the largest ID among all initiators are guaranteed
not to complete (that is, are extinguished), because the initiator with the largest
ID will refuse to take part in these waves. Conversely, the wave of the initiator with
the largest ID is guaranteed to complete, because each process will eventually switch
to this wave.
Example 9.7 We consider a computation of the echo algorithm with extinction on
an undirected ring of three processes 0, 1, 2, which are all initiators.
– The three processes all start a wave, and send a wave message to their two neighbors,
tagged with their ID.
– The wave messages from 0, tagged with 0, are purged by 1 and 2.
– 0 receives the wave message from 1, tagged with 1. As a result, 0 changes to 1’s
wave, makes 1 its parent, and sends a wave message to 2, tagged with 1.
– The wave messages tagged with 1 from 0 and 1 are purged by 2.
– 0 and 1 receive the wave message from 2, tagged with 2. As a result, they change
to 2’s wave, make 2 their parent, and send a wave message to each other, tagged
with 2.
– 0 and 1 receive each other’s wave message, tagged with 2. Next, they send a wave
message tagged with 2 to their parent 2.
– 2 receives the wave messages from 0 and 1, tagged with 2. As a result, 2’s wave
decides, and 2 becomes the leader.
The worst-case message complexity of this echo algorithm with extinction is
O(NE): there are at most N waves, and each wave uses at most 2E messages.
80 9 Election
9.4 Minimum spanning trees
We now turn our attention to a topic that at first sight has little to do with election:
minimum spanning trees. However, the distributed algorithm for constructing a minimum
spanning tree that is discussed in this section will turn out to yield an efficient
election algorithm.
Given is an undirected network, in which the channels carry positive weights. A
minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of the network for which the sum of the
weights of its channels is minimal. They can be employed, for example, to minimize
the cost of broadcasting messages through the network.
For convenience we assume that different channels in the network always have
different weights; this guarantees that the minimum spanning tree is unique. Alternatively,
we could allow different channels to have the same weight, and impose a
total order on channels with the same weight, using the IDs of the end points of a
channel.
The Gallager-Humblet-Spira algorithm is a distributed version of Kruskal’s famous
algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees in a uniprocessor setting.We
first briefly discuss Kruskal’s algorithm, which uses the notion of a fragment, being
any connected subgraph of the minimum spanning tree. A channel in the network is
said to be an outgoing edge for a fragment if exactly one of the processes connected
by the channel is in the fragment. Kruskal’s algorithm is based on the observation
that the lowest-weight outgoing edge c of a fragment F is always in the minimum
spanning tree. Otherwise, the minimum spanning tree extended with c would contain
a cycle, which would include c and another outgoing edge d of F. Replacing d by
c in the minimum spanning tree would give another spanning tree of the network,
and the sum of the weights of its channels would be smaller than for the minimum
spanning tree. This is a contradiction.
In Kruskal’s algorithm, initially each process in the network forms a separate
fragment. In each step, two different (disjoint) fragments are joined into one fragment
via a channel between these fragments that is the lowest-weight outgoing edge for
at least one of the two fragments. The algorithm terminates when only one fragment
remains.
In a distributed setting, it becomes complicated for a process to decide whether
its channels are outgoing edges or not. For each of its channels, it has to communicate
with the process at the other side to find out whether it is in the same fragment. And if
one of its channels turns out to be an outgoing edge, the process has to work together
with the other processes in its fragment to determine whether it is the least-weight
outgoing edge for the fragment. And when finally the least-weight outgoing edge for
the fragment has been detected, the fragment at the other side of the channel has to
be asked to join together, so that the two fragments become one.
In the Gallager-Humblet-Spira algorithm, each fragment carries a name, which
is a nonnegative real number, and a level, which is a natural number. Processes keep
track of the name and level of their fragment. Each fragment has a unique name,
except initially, when each process starts as a fragment with name and level 0. The
level of a fragment is the maximum number of joins any process in the fragment has
9.4 Minimum spanning trees 81
experienced. When two fragments join, there are two scenarios. If the two joining
fragments have different levels, the one with the lowest level copies the name and
level of the other fragment (in which case the processes in the other fragment do not
experience the join). If they have the same level, the new name of the joint fragment
is the weight of the so-called core edge via which they are joined, and the level is
increased by one.
The core edge of a fragment, that is, the last channel via which two subfragments
were joined at the same level, plays a key role in the algorithm. It is the central
computing unit of the fragment, to which the processes in the fragment report the
lowest-weight outgoing edge they are aware of, and from where the join via the
lowest-weight outgoing edge of the fragment is initiated. Each process has a parent,
toward the core edge of its fragment (except initially, when fragments consist of a
single process). The end points of a core edge are called the core nodes; they have
each other as parent.
Processes are in one of the following three states:
• sleep: this is a special state for noninitiators, so that this algorithm for computing
minimum spanning trees can be easily turned in an election algorithm, where we
must allow for any nonempty set of initiators. A process that is asleep wakes up
as soon as it receives any message.
• find: the process is looking for its lowest-weight outgoing edge, and/or waiting
for its children to report the lowest-weight outgoing edge they are aware of.
• found: the process has reported the lowest-weight outgoing edge it is aware of to
its parent, and is waiting either for an instruction from the core edge that a join
should be performed via that channel, or for a message informing that a join has
been completed elsewhere in the fragment.
Moreover, processes maintain a status for each of their channels:
• basic edge: it is undecided whether the channel is part of the minimum spanning
tree.
• branch edge: the channel is part of the minimum spanning tree.
• rejected: the channel is not part of the minimum spanning tree.
Each initiator, and each noninitiator after it has woken up, sets its lowest-weight
channel to branch, its other channels to basic, and its state to found. It sends the
message ⟨connect, 0⟩ into the branch edge, to inform the fragment at the other side
that it wants to join via this channel, and that its fragment has level 0.
Let two fragments, one with name fn and level ℓ, and the other with name fn′ and
level ℓ′, be joined via channel pq, where p is in the first and q in the second fragment.
Let ℓ ≤ ℓ′. As explained before, there are two possible scenarios.
• If ℓ < ℓ′, then in the past p sent ⟨connect, ℓ⟩ to q, and now q sends the message
⟨initiate, fn′, ℓ′, find
found ⟩ to p. We write find
found to express that this parameter can
be either find or found, depending on the state q is in.
• If ℓ = ℓ′, then in the past p and q sent ⟨connect, ℓ⟩ to each other, and now they
send ⟨initiate, weight of pq, ℓ + 1, find⟩ to each other.
82 9 Election
At the reception of a message ⟨initiate, fn, ℓ, find
found ⟩, a process stores fn and ℓ as
the name and level of its fragment, assumes the state find or found depending on the
last parameter in the message, and adopts the sender as its parent. It passes on the
message through its other branch edges.
In the first scenario, q is in the fragment with the higher level, so that its initiate
message imposes the name and level of its fragment onto p. Moreover, p makes q its
parent, toward the core edge of q’s fragment. By forwarding the initiate message
through its other branch edges, p ensures that all other processes in its fragment
update the name and level of their fragment, and select a new parent toward the core
edge of q’s fragment.
In the second scenario, both fragments have the same level, so that the joint
fragment gets a new name, level and core edge. The new name is the weight of the
channel pq, the new level is the old level plus one, and the new core edge is pq. Since
all processes in both fragments must be informed, p and q send an initiate message
with the new name and level to each other. As this message is forwarded through the
branch edges, the processes in the joint fragment select a new parent toward the core
edge pq. The parameter find in the initiate message makes sure that these processes
moreover start looking for the lowest-weight outgoing edge of the joint fragment.
When a process p receives a message ⟨initiate, fn, ℓ, find⟩, it starts checking in
increasing order of weight whether one of its basic edges pq is outgoing, by sending
⟨test, fn, ℓ⟩ to q and waiting for an answer from q. A basic edge pq that was found
to be outgoing before has to be tested again, as in the meantime the fragments of p
and q may have joined. At reception of the test message, q acts as follows.
• If ℓ is greater than the level of q’s fragment, then q postpones processing the
incoming test message, until the level of q’s fragment has reached or surpassed
ℓ. The reason for this postponement is that p and q might actually be in the same
fragment, in which case the message ⟨initiate, fn, ℓ, find⟩ is on its way to q.
• If ℓ is not greater than the level of q’s fragment, then q checks whether the name
of q’s fragment is fn. If so, then q replies with a reject message to p (except if
q is awaiting a reply to a test message to p, because then p and q can interpret
each other’s message ⟨test, fn, ℓ⟩ as a reject). As a result, p and q will both set
the status of the channel pq to rejected. If not, then q replies with an accept
message to p.
When a basic edge is accepted or there are no basic edges left, p stops the search for
its lowest-weight outgoing basic edge.
Moreover, p waits for report messages through its branch edges, except the
one to its parent. Then p sets its state to found, and computes the minimum λp of
these reports and the weight of its lowest-weight outgoing basic edge (or ∞, if no
such edge was found). If λp < ∞, then p stores the branch edge through which it
received λp, or its outgoing basic edge of weight λp. Finally, p sends ⟨report, λp⟩ to its parent.
Only the core nodes receive a report message from their parent. If the minimum
reported value is∞, then the core nodes terminate, because then the minimum
spanning tree has been computed. If the minimum reported value μ is smaller than
9.4 Minimum spanning trees 83
∞, then the core node that received μ first sends a changeroot message via branch
edges toward the process p that originally reported its channel pq with weight μ as its
lowest-weight outgoing basic edge. Here it is used that processes stored their branch
edge that reported μ. From then on, the core edge becomes a regular (tree) edge.
When p receives the changeroot message, it sets the channel pq to branch, and
sends ⟨connect, ℓ⟩ into it, where ℓ is the level of p’s fragment.
Let a process q receive a message ⟨connect, ℓ⟩ from a neighbor p. We note that
the level of q’s fragment is at least ℓ: either ℓ = 0, or q earlier sent accept to p,
which it could only do if its fragment had a level of at least ℓ, and fragment levels
never decrease over time. Now q acts as follows:
• As long as q’s fragment has level ℓ and qp is not a branch edge, q postpones
processing the connect message from p. The reason for this postponement is
that q’s fragment might be in the process of joining a fragment with a level ≥ ℓ, in which case p’s fragment should subsume the name and level of that joint
fragment, instead of joining q’s fragment at an equal level.
• When the level ℓ′ of q’s fragment is or becomes greater than ℓ, q sets the channel
qp to branch and sends ⟨initiate, fn′, ℓ′, find
found ⟩ to p, where fn′ is the name of
q’s fragment, and find or found depends on the state of q.
• When q’s fragment has level ℓ and qp is or becomes a branch edge (in which case
q sent ⟨connect, ℓ⟩ to p), q sends ⟨initiate, weight of qp, ℓ+1, find⟩ to p (and
vice versa).
In the last case, pq becomes the core edge of the joint fragment.
This completes the description of the Gallager-Humblet-Spira algorithm; we are
back at the situation where two fragments are joined at a different or the same level,
by means of one or two initiate messages, respectively, which was explained before.
Example 9.8 We consider one possible computation of the Gallager-Humblet-Spira
algorithm on the following network, in which all processes are initiators.
p q

– p and q send ⟨connect, 0⟩ to each other, after which they both make the channel
pq a branch edge. Since these fragments join at the same level 0, p and q send
⟨initiate, 5, 1, find⟩ to each other. Next, p and q send ⟨test, 5, 1⟩ to s and r,
respectively.
84 9 Election
– t sends ⟨connect, 0⟩ to q, after which it makes the channel tq a branch edge.
Since the fragment of q is at level 1, q replies with ⟨initiate, 5, 1, find⟩. Then t
sends ⟨report,∞⟩ to its new parent q, as t has no channels except tq.
– r and s send ⟨connect, 0⟩ to each other, after which they both make the channel
rs a branch edge. Since these fragments join at the same level 0, r and s send
⟨initiate, 3, 1, find⟩ to each other. Next, r and s send ⟨test, 3, 1⟩ to q and p,
respectively.
– Since the fragments of r and s are at the same level as the fragments of q and
p, but have a different name, r and s reply to the test message from q and p,
respectively, with an accept message. As a result, p sends ⟨report, 9⟩ to its
parent q, while q sends ⟨report, 7⟩ to its parent p. Because 7 is smaller than 9,
q sends ⟨connect, 1⟩ to r.
– Since the fragments of p and q are at the same level as the fragments of s and
r, but have a different name, p and q can reply to the test message from s and
r, respectively, with an accept message. As a result, r sends ⟨report, 7⟩ to its
parent s, while s sends ⟨report, 9⟩ to its parent r. As 7 is smaller than 9, r sends
⟨connect, 1⟩ to q.
– By the crossing ⟨connect, 1⟩ messages between q and r, the channel between
these processes becomes a branch edge as well as the core edge of the new fragment,
which has level 2. Messages ⟨initiate, 7, 2, find⟩ are forwarded through
the branch edges. The channels pr and ps are tested (in this order) from either
side, both times leading to a reject. Finally, all processes report∞, and the algorithm
terminates.
So the minimum spanning tree consists of the channels pq, qr, qt, and rs.
We argue that the Gallager-Humblet-Spira algorithm is deadlock-free. There are
two potential causes for deadlock, because a process q may postpone an incoming
message. The first case is if q receives a message ⟨test, fn, ℓ⟩ while ℓ is greater than
the level of q’s fragment. This postponement does not lead to a deadlock, because
there is always a fragment of minimal level, and test messages originating from
this fragment will be answered promptly. The second case is if q receives a message
⟨connect, ℓ⟩ while the level of q’s fragment equals ℓ and qp is not a branch edge.
This postponement also does not lead to a deadlock, because different edges have
different weights, so there cannot be a cycle of fragments waiting for a reply to a
postponed connect message.
The worst-case message complexity of the Gallager-Humblet-Spira algorithm is
O(E +N logN). The summand E is the accumulation of all messages for rejecting
channels: each channel outside the minimum spanning tree is rejected by a testreject
or test-test pair. This adds up to 2(E − (N − 1)) messages in total. Furthermore,
each process experiences at most ⌊log2 N⌋ joins, because each time this
happens the level at the process increases, and a fragment at a level ℓ contains at least
2ℓ processes (see exercise 9.6). Each time a process experiences a join, it receives
an initiate message, and may send the following four messages: one test that triggers
an accept message, a report, and a changeroot or connect. Including the
accept, these are five messages every time a process experiences a join, adding up
Exercises 85
to at most 5N⌊log2 N⌋ messages in total. Thus we have covered all messages in the
algorithm.
Finally, as promised at the start of this section, we return to election. By two
extra messages at the very end of the Gallager-Humblet-Spira algorithm, the core
node with the largest ID can become the leader. This yields an election algorithm for
undirected networks.
The lower bound of Ω(N logN) for rings mentioned before implies a lower
bound of Ω(E + N logN) on the average-case message complexity of any election
algorithm for general networks. So the message complexity of the Gallager-Humblet-
Spira algorithm is optimal.

The Chang-Roberts algorithm originates from [19], and Franklin’s algorithm from
[33]. The Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh algorithm was proposed independently in [27] and
in [63]. The lower bound of Ω(N logN) on the average-case message complexity
of election algorithms for rings was proved in [61]. The Gallager-Humblet-Spira
algorithm stems from [35].

Anonymous Networks
Sometimes the processes in a network are anonymous, meaning that they may lack
a unique ID. Typically, this is the case if there are no unique hardware IDs (for
example, LEGO Mindstorms). Furthermore, when processes do have unique IDs but
they cannot reveal their ID to other processes, this is similar to having no unique
process IDs at all. For instance, processes may not want to reveal their ID for security
concerns, or transmitting/storing IDs may be deemed too expensive, as is the case for
the IEEE 1394 serial bus discussed in section 10.7.
In this section we assume that processes (and channels) do not have a unique ID.
10.1 Impossibility of election in anonymous rings
We show that there does not exist an election algorithm that always terminates on
any anonymous network. The idea is that if the initial configuration is symmetric
(typically, a ring in which all processes are in the same state and all channels are
empty), then there is always an infinite execution that cannot escape this symmetry.
Apparently, unique process IDs are a crucial ingredient for the election algorithms in
chapter 9 to break symmetry.
Note that vice versa, if one leader has been elected, all processes can be given a
unique ID using a traversal algorithm (see section 4.1) initiated by the leader.
We recall from chapter 9 that election algorithms are decentralized. The initiators
can be any nonempty set of processes, and all processes must have the same local
algorithm.
Theorem 10.1 No election algorithm for anonymous rings always terminates.
Proof. Suppose we have an election algorithm for (directed or undirected) anonymous
rings. We run it on an anonymous ring of sizeN >1.
A configuration of the algorithm on the ring is symmetric if all processes are in
the same state and all channels carry the same messages. We make three observations:
88 10 Anonymous Networks
• There is a symmetric initial configuration: All processes can be provided with
the same initial state, and initially all channels are empty.
• In a symmetric configuration there is not one leader, because all processes are in
the same state.
• If γ0 is a symmetric configuration and γ0 → γ1, then there is a sequence of transitions
γ1 → γ2 → · · · → γN where γN is symmetric. Namely, the transition
γ0 → γ1 is caused by an internal, send, or receive event at some process. Since in
γ0 all processes are in the same state and all channels carry the same messages,
all other processes in the ring can also perform this event, and the resulting configuration
γN is symmetric.
These observations together imply that the election algorithm exhibits an infinite
execution, which infinitely often visits a symmetric configuration.
We can even construct an infinite execution that is fair; that is, if an event can happen
in infinitely many configurations in the execution, then this event is performed
infinitely often during the execution. Namely, given the symmetric configuration γ0
in the third case above, it does not matter which event available in γ0 is used for the
transition γ0 → γ1; we can always build the transition sequence to the symmetric
configuration γN. This implies that we can make sure no event is ignored infinitely
often in the infinite execution. ⊓#
10.2 Probabilistic algorithms
In view of the impossibility result in the previous section, we now turn to probabilistic
algorithms, in which a process may, for example, flip a coin and perform an
event based on the outcome of this coin flip. That is, events can happen with a certain
probability.
For probabilistic algorithms, we can calculate the probability that an execution
from some set of possible executions will occur. Although in the previous section
we proved that election algorithms for anonymous rings inevitably contain infinite
executions, in the next section we will see that there exists such an algorithm in
which the probability that an infinite execution occurs is zero.
Probabilistic algorithms for which all executions terminate in a correct configuration
are in general not so interesting (except sometimes from a complexity point of
view). Any deterministic version of such an algorithm (for example, let the coin flip
always yield heads) produces a correct nonprobabilistic algorithm.We therefore consider
two classes of probabilistic algorithms: ones that always terminate but that may
terminate incorrectly, and ones that may not terminate but if they do the outcome is
always correct.
A probabilistic algorithm is Las Vegas if:
• the probability that it terminates is greater than zero, and
• all terminal configurations are correct.
It is Monte Carlo if:
10.3 Itai-Rodeh election algorithm for rings 89
• it always terminates, and
• the probability that a terminal configuration is correct is greater than zero.
Note that if the probability that a Las Vegas algorithm terminates is one, there
may still be infinite executions. But in this case the probability mass of all infinite
executions together is zero. For example, consider an algorithm which consists of
flipping a fair coin as long as the result is heads, and which terminates as soon as the
result of a coin flip is tails. The algorithm has one infinite execution, in which every
time the outcome of the coin flip is heads. But the probability that this execution
occurs is zero.
10.3 Itai-Rodeh election algorithm for rings
The Itai-Rodeh election algorithm targets anonymous directed rings. Although in
section 10.1 it was shown that there is no terminating election algorithm for this
setting, the Itai-Rodeh election algorithm will achieve the next best thing: a Las
Vegas algorithm that terminates with probability one.
We adapt the Chang-Roberts algorithm from section 9.1. Each initiator again
sends out its ID, and messages with the largest ID are the only one completing their
round trip. However, since we are working with an anonymous ring, processes do not
have a unique ID. Therefore, each initiator randomly selects an ID. The complication
then, of course, is that different processes may select the same ID, in which case the
election can be inconclusive.
The Itai-Rodeh election algorithm therefore progresses in rounds. If in a round
one active process selects a larger ID than any other active process, then it becomes
the leader. If, on the other hand, multiple active processes select the largest ID in
that round, then there will be a next round, in which only the active processes that
selected the largest ID may participate. At the start of every round, active processes
randomly select a new ID. Active processes keep track of round numbers, so that they
can ignore messages from earlier rounds; we will see that this is essential, as else
the algorithm could terminate in a configuration where all processes have become
passive.
Since different processes may select the same ID, a process cannot readily recognize
its own message when it completes the round trip. Therefore, each message
is supplied with a hop count, which keeps track of how many processes have been
visited so far. A message arrives at its source if and only if its hop count is N. Hence,
it is required that processes know the ring size; in section 10.5 we will see that this
requirement is crucial.
Now the Itai-Rodeh election algorithm is presented in more detail. Initially, initiators
are active at the start of election round 0, and noninitiators are passive. At the
start of an election round n ≥ 0, an active process p randomly selects an ID id p
from {1, . . . , N} and sends the message (n, id p, 1, false) into its outgoing channel.
The first value is the number of the election round in which this message evolved,
the second value the ID of its source, the third value the hop count, and the fourth
90 10 Anonymous Networks
value a Boolean that is set when an active process different from p with the ID id p is
encountered during the round trip.
Next, p waits for a message (n′, i, h, b) to arrive. When this happens, p acts as
follows, depending on the parameter values in this message.
• n′ > n, or n′ = n and i > id p:
p has received a message from a future round, or from the current round with a
larger ID. It becomes passive and sends (n′, i, h + 1, b).
• n′ < n, or n′ = n and i < id p:
p has received a message from an earlier round, or from the current round with a
smaller ID. It purges the message.
• n′ = n, i = id p and h < N:
p has received a message from the current round with its own ID, but with a hop
count smaller than N. Therefore, p is not the source of this message. It sends
(n, id p, h + 1, true).
• n′ = n, i = id p, h = N and b = true:
p has received back its own message. Since the Boolean was set to true during
the round trip, another active process selected the same ID as p in this round.
Therefore, p proceeds to round n + 1.
• n′ = n, i = id p, h = N and b = false:
p has received back its own message. Since the Boolean is still false, all other
processes selected a smaller ID in this round and have become passive. Therefore,
p becomes the leader.
Passive processes simply pass on messages, increasing their hop count by one.
The Itai-Rodeh election algorithm is a Las Vegas algorithm that terminates with
probability one. There are infinite executions, in which active processes keep on
selecting the same ID in every election round. However, in each election round with
multiple active processes, with a positive probability not all active processes select
the same ID. And in that case, not all active processes will make it to the next round.
Therefore, with probability one, eventually one process will become the leader.
The following example shows that without round numbers the algorithm would
be flawed.
Example 10.1 We consider one possible computation of the Itai-Rodeh election algorithm
on an anonymous directed ring of size three. The processes p, q, r are all
initiators and know that the ring size is three.
– In round 0, p and q both select ID i, while r selects ID j, with i > j. The message
sent by q makes r passive, its Boolean is set at p, and it returns to q. Likewise,
the Boolean in the message sent by p is set at q, and returns to p. Next, p and q
move to the next round.
– In round 1, p and q select IDs k and ℓ, respectively, with j > k > ℓ. The
message sent by r in round 0 is slow; only now it reaches p. If round numbers
were omitted, then p and subsequently q would not recognize that r’s message is
from the previous round, and would become passive. Owing to round numbers,
10.4 Echo algorithm with extinction for anonymous networks 91
however, r’s message is purged by p, and p and q continue to compete for the
leadership. Since k > ℓ, the message from q is purged at p, while the message
from p makes q passive and returns to p with Boolean true. So p becomes the
leader.
The computation in example 10.1 uses in an essential way that channels are not
FIFO. In case of FIFO channels, round numbers can be omitted.
It can be shown that, in case all processes are initiators, the average-case message
complexity of the Itai-Rodeh election algorithm is O(N logN): on average, the N
messages travel a logarithmic number of hops before they are purged, and the average
number of election rounds is finite. In view of the lower bound of Ω(N logN) on
the average-case message complexity of election algorithms for rings mentioned in
the previous chapter, one cannot hope to do better in a fully asynchronous setting.
Similar to the way the Chang-Roberts algorithm for election in directed rings
was turned into a probabilistic version for anonymous directed rings, Franklin’s algorithm
for undirected rings can be turned into a probabilistic version for anonymous
undirected rings. An advantage of the latter probabilistic algorithm, compared to the
Itai-Rodeh algorithm, is that round numbers modulo 2, that is, only 0 and 1, suffice.
10.4 Echo algorithm with extinction for anonymous networks
The echo algorithm with extinction from section 9.3 can be adapted to anonymous
undirected networks similar to the adaptation of the Chang-Roberts algorithm in the
previous section. The resulting election algorithm progresses in rounds; at the start of
every round, the active processes randomly select an ID and run the echo algorithm
with extinction. Again, round numbers are used to recognize messages from earlier
rounds. When a process is hit by a wave with a higher round number than its current
wave, or with the same round number but a higher ID, the process becomes passive
(if it was not already) and moves to that other wave.
Processes again need to know the network size, to be able to determine at completion
of their wave whether it has covered the entire network. Namely, different waves
with the same ID in the same round can collide with each other, after which these
waves may both complete, but then covered disjoint parts of the network. Therefore,
when a process sends a wave message to its parent, it reports the size of its subgraph
in this wave, so that in the end the initiator of this wave can determine how many
processes participated in its wave. If a wave completes but did not cover the entire
network, then the initiator moves to the next election round. If a completed wave
covered the entire network, then its initiator becomes the leader.
We now present the echo algorithm with extinction for election in anonymous
undirected networks in more detail. Initially, initiators are active at the start of round
0, and noninitiators are passive.
Let process p be active. At the start of an election round n ≥ 0, p randomly
selects an ID id p ∈ {1, . . . , N}, and starts a wave, tagged with n and id p. As a third
parameter it adds a 0, meaning that this is not a message to its parent. This third
parameter is used to report the subtree size in messages to a parent.
92 10 Anonymous Networks
A process p, which is in a wave from round n with ID i, waits for a wave message
to arrive, tagged with a round number n′ and an ID j. When this happens, p acts as
follows, depending on the parameter values in this message.
• If n′ > n, or n′ = n and j > i, then p makes the sender its parent, changes to
the wave in round n′ with ID j, and treats the message accordingly.
• If n′ < n, or n′ = n and j < i, then p purges the message.
• If n′ = n and j = i, then p treats the message according to the echo algorithm.
As we said, the echo algorithm is adapted by letting each message sent upward in
the constructed tree report the size of its subtree; all other wave messages report 0.
When a process decides, meaning that its wave completes, it computes the size of
the constructed tree. If this equals the network size N, then the process becomes the
leader. Otherwise, it moves to the next election round, in which it randomly selects
a new ID from {1, . . . , N}, and initiates a new wave.
This election algorithm is a Las Vegas algorithm that terminates with probability
one. There are infinite executions, in which active processes keep on selecting the
same ID in every election round. However, with a positive probability, in election
rounds with multiple active processes, not all active processes select the same ID.
And in that case, not all active processes will make it to the next round. Therefore,
with probability one, eventually one process will become the leader.
Example 10.2 We consider one possible computation of the echo algorithm with
extinction on the anonymous undirected network below. All processes know that the
network size is six.
– In round 0, processes p, r, t select ID i and processes q, s, u select ID j, with
i > j. In the picture below, only the messages carrying ID i are shown; the
messages carrying j are all purged at reception. Messages that are depicted with
a solid arrow head are toward a parent.
p q r s t
u
(0, i, 0) (0, i, 0)
(0, i, 1) (0, i, 1)
(0, i, 0)
(0, i, 0)
(0, i, 0)
(0, i, 0)
(0, i, 0) (0, i, 1)
p, r, t start their wave by sending (0, i, 0) to their neighbors. Next, q and s receive
the message from p and t, respectively, and send (0, i, 0) to r. When q and s
receive (0, i, 0) from r, they interpret this as an answer to their message to r,
reporting a subtree of size 0. So q and s report a subtree of size 1 to p and t,
respectively. Moreover, u receives (0, i, 0) from r, and reports a subtree of size 1
to r. Finally, p, r, t all compute that their wave covered two processes and move
to round 1.
10.5 Computing the size of an anonymous ring is impossible 93
– In round 1, p selects ID k, and r, t select ID ℓ, with k > ℓ. In the next picture,
only the messages carrying ID k are shown.
p q r s t
u
(0, k, 0) (0, k, 0)
(0, k, 5) (0, k, 1)
(0, k, 0)
(0, k, 4)
(0, k, 0)
(0, k, 2)
(0, k, 0) (0, k, 1)
The wave of p completes and reports that it covered six processes. So p becomes
the leader.
Note that in round 1 another scenario would be possible, in which the wave of t
completes, and t computes that its wave covered two processes, so that it moves to
round 2. However, in the computation we consider, the wave of p in round 1 travels
faster than the waves of r and t, so that the wave of p completes.
It can be shown that, in case all processes are initiators, the average-case message
complexity of the echo algorithm with extinction is O(E): every round takes 2E
messages, and the average number of election rounds is finite.
10.5 Computing the size of an anonymous ring is impossible
In the previous sections we discussed Las Vegas algorithms for election in anonymous
networks, which require that all processes in the network know the network
size.We now prove that this assumption is essential. There is no Las Vegas algorithm
to compute the size of anonymous rings; every probabilistic algorithm for computing
the size of anonymous rings must allow for incorrect outcomes. This implies that
there is no Las Vegas algorithm for election in anonymous rings if processes do not
know the ring size. Because when there is one leader, network size can be computed
using a wave algorithm, initiated by the leader.
Theorem 10.2 There is no Las Vegas algorithm to compute the size of an anonymous
ring.
Proof. Suppose we have an algorithm for computing the size of a (directed or undirected)
anonymous ring of size N > 2, with processes p0, . . . , pN−1. Let C be a
computation of the algorithm on this ring that terminates with the correct outcome
N.We cut open this ring between p0 and pN−1, and glue a copy p′0, . . . , p′N−1 of the
ring in between. That is, we consider the following anonymous ring, of size 2N.
94 10 Anonymous Networks
p0
p′0
p′1
p′N−1 p1
pN−1
Let the computation C′ on this ring consist of replaying C twice; once on the half
p0, . . . , pN−1 and once on the half p′0, . . . , p′N−1. In C′, compared to C, p0 communicates
with p′N−1 instead of pN−1, and pN−1 communicates with p′0 instead of p0.
But since p0 and p′0 send the same messages in C′, and likewise for pN−1 and p′N−1,
and they do not have unique IDs to tell each other apart, none of these four processes
can determine this difference. In C′ the processes in the ring of size 2N terminate
with the incorrect outcome N. ⊓"
10.6 Itai-Rodeh ring size algorithm
The Itai-Rodeh ring size algorithm targets anonymous directed rings. In section 10.5
it was shown that it must be a Monte Carlo algorithm, meaning that it must allow for
incorrect outcomes. However, in the Itai-Rodeh ring size algorithm the probability
of an erroneous outcome can be arbitrarily close to zero, by letting the processes
randomly select IDs from a sufficiently large domain.
Each process p maintains an estimate estp of the ring size; initially estp = 2.
During any execution of the algorithm, estp will never exceed the correct estimate
N. The algorithm proceeds in estimate rounds. Every time a process finds that its
estimate is too conservative, it moves to another round. That is, a process p initiates
an estimate round at the start of the algorithm, and at each update of estp.
Each round, p randomly selects an ID id p from {1, . . . , R} and sends the message
(estp, id p, 1) to its next neighbor. The third value is a hop count, which is
increased by one every time the message is forwarded.
Now p waits for a message (est, id, h) to arrive. An invariant of such messages
is that always h ≤ est. When a message arrives, p acts as follows, depending on the
parameter values in this message.
• est < estp:
The estimate of the message is more conservative than p’s estimate, so p purges
the message.
• est > estp:
The estimate of the message improves upon p’s estimate, so p increases its estimate.
We distinguish two cases.
10.6 Itai-Rodeh ring size algorithm 95
– h < est:
The estimate est may be correct. So p sends (est, id, h + 1), to give the
message the chance to complete its round trip. Moreover, p performs estp ← est.
– h = est:
The estimate est is too conservative, because the message traveled est hops
but did not complete its round trip. So p performs estp ← est + 1.
• est = estp:
The estimate of the message and of p agree. We distinguish two cases.
– h < est:
p sends (est, id, h+1), to give the message the chance to complete its round
trip.
– h = est:
Once again we distinguish two cases.
∗ id ̸= id p:
The estimate est is too conservative, because the message traveled est hops
but did not complete its round trip. So p performs estp ← est + 1.
∗ id = id p:
Possibly p’s own message returned. (Or a message originating from a process
est hops before p that unfortunately happened to select the same ID as p in
this estimate round.) In this case, p purges the message.
When the algorithm terminates, estp ≤ N for all processes p, because processes
increase their estimate only when they are certain it is too conservative. Furthermore,
estp converges to the same value at all processes p. For if this were not the case,
clearly there would be processes p and q where p is q’s predecessor in the ring and
p’s final estimate is larger than the one of q. But then p’s message in its final estimate
round would have increased q’s estimate to p’s estimate.
The Itai-Rodeh ring size algorithm is a Monte Carlo algorithm: it may terminate
with an estimate smaller than N. This can happen if in a round with an estimate
est < N all processes at distance est from each other happen to select the same ID.
Example 10.3 We consider one possible computation of the Itai-Rodeh ring size
algorithm on the following anonymous ring, which is directed in a clockwise fashion.
r
s
p
q
In the initial estimate round with estimate 2, let p and r select ID i, while q and
s select ID j. Then p and r send the message (2, i, 1), which is forwarded by q and
s, respectively, as (2, i, 2). Likewise, q and s send (2, j, 1), which is forwarded by r
96 10 Anonymous Networks
and p, respectively, as (2, j, 2). So all four processes receive a message (2, k, 2) with
k equal to their own ID. Hence, the algorithm terminates with the wrong estimate 2.
Example 10.4 We give another computation of the Itai-Rodeh ring size algorithm on
the anonymous directed ring from example 10.3, which does converge to the correct
estimate. In the initial estimate round, let p select ID i, while q and s select ID j,
and r selects ID k ̸= i. Then p and r send messages (2, i, 1) and (2, k, 1), which
are forwarded by q and s, as (2, i, 2) and (2, k, 2), respectively. Since i ̸= k, these
messages make p and r progress to the next estimate round, in which they both select
ID j and send (3, j, 1). These messages make q and s progress to the next estimate
round, because the estimate of these messages is larger that the estimate of q and s.
Let q select ID j and s ID ℓ ̸= j. In this estimate round, the messages (3, j, 3) and
(3, ℓ, 3) that originate from p and s, respectively, make s and r progress to the next
estimate round. The messages from r and s in this last round make p and q progress to
the next estimate round too. Finally, all processes terminate with the correct estimate
4.
The probability that the algorithm terminates with an incorrect outcome becomes
smaller when the domain {1, . . . , R} from which random IDs are drawn is made
larger. This probability tends to zero when R tends to infinity (for a fixed N).
The worst-case message complexity is O(N3): each process starts at most N −1
estimate rounds, and each round it sends out one message, which takes at most N
steps.
10.7 Election in IEEE 1394
The IEEE 1394 serial bus interface standard contains protocols for connecting devices,
in order to carry different forms of digital video and audio. Its architecture is
scalable, and devices can be added or removed.
We concentrate on the election algorithm in IEEE 1394, which is employed when
devices have been added to or removed from the network. Since it is deemed too
expensive to store IDs of other processes, no IDs are attached to messages. This
means that election is basically performed within an anonymous network. In view of
the dynamic nature of the network, processes are not aware of the network size. We
have seen in the previous section that no Las Vegas algorithm exists for these types
of networks, if cycles can be present. The topology of the undirected network is here
assumed to be acyclic, and a variant of the tree election algorithm from section 9.2
is employed. While in the tree election algorithm the process with the largest ID
becomes the leader, in IEEE 1394 the leader is selected among the two processes
that send a parent request to each other.
All processes in the network are initiators (so no wake-up phase is needed). When
a process has one possible parent, it sends a parent request to this neighbor. If the request
is accepted, an acknowledgment is sent back. The last two parentless processes
may send parent requests to each other simultaneously; this is called root contention.
Exercises 97
A process p finds itself in root contention if it receives a parent request instead of an
acknowledgment from a neighbor q in reply to its parent request. Then p randomly
decides to either immediately send a parent request again, or wait some time for another
parent request from q. In the latter case, if p does not receive another parent
request from q within the waiting period, then p once again randomly decides to either
immediately send a parent request or wait some more time. Root contention is
resolved when one of the processes waits while the other sends immediately. Then
the process that is waiting becomes the leader.
Example 10.5 We run the IEEE 1394 election protocol on an acyclic undirected
network of three processes p, q, r, with channels pq and qr.
– p and r have only one possible parent, so they send a parent request to q.
– q receives the parent request of r and sends an acknowledgment back to r.
– q has only one possible parent left, so it sends a parent request to p. Now p and q
are in root contention.
– p and q receive each other’s parent requests. Now p (randomly) decides to wait
some time, while q decides to send a parent request again immediately.
– p receives the parent request of q and sends back an acknowledgment. Thus p has
become the leader.
In practice the election algorithm in IEEE 1394 is sometimes employed on networks
that contain a cycle, which leads to a deadlock. For example, if the network
is an undirected ring, no process ever sends a parent request, because every process
has two possible parents. Therefore, the election algorithm contains a timeout mechanism,
so that networks containing a cycle lead to a timeout.
Bibliographical notes
The impossibility results regarding election in and computing the size of an anonymous
network date back to [4]. The Itai-Rodeh election and ring size algorithms
originate from [39]. A variant of the Itai-Rodeh election algorithm without round
numbers in case of FIFO channels was proposed in [32]. A probabilistic version of
Franklin’s algorithm was presented in [9]. The echo algorithm with extinction for
anonymous networks stems from [76]. The IEEE 1394 standard was published in
[38].

Synchronous Networks
A synchronous system is a network in which the processes proceed in lockstep. That
is, a synchronous system proceeds in pulses, and in each pulse, each process:
1. sends messages to its neighbors,
2. receives messages from its neighbors, and
3. performs internal events.
Messages that are sent in a pulse must reach their destination before the receiver
moves to the next pulse.
A synchronizer turns a network with asynchronous communication into a synchronous
system. Thus one can develop a distributed algorithm for synchronous
systems, which in some cases is easier than developing it for a setting with fully
asynchronous communication, and then use a synchronizer to make this algorithm
applicable to general networks.
11.1 A simple synchronizer
A synchronizer must make sure that a process only moves to the next pulse when it
has received all messages for its current pulse. A simple synchronizer can be implemented
as follows. At the start of each pulse, processes are required to send exactly
one message to each neighbor. If a process wants to send multiple messages to a
neighbor in one pulse, these can be lumped together. If a process does not want to
send a message to a neighbor in a pulse, it sends a dummy message. When a process
has received a message from all its neighbors in a pulse, it can perform internal
events, and move to the next pulse. The simple synchronizer can be initiated by any
process, by sending messages to all its neighbors in the first pulse.
Initialization gives a time delay of at most D time units, after which each process
will have received a message. If the last process to start a pulse does so at time t,
then each process is guaranteed to receive its messages in this pulse no later than
time t + 1. Hence, the time overhead is at most one time unit per pulse.
102 11 Synchronous Networks
The main drawback of the simple synchronizer is a high message overhead: every
pulse in the worst case gives rise to 2E dummy messages.
11.2 Awerbuch’s synchronizer
Awerbuch’s synchronizer for undirected networks comprises three classes of synchronizers:
α, β, and γ. The α synchronizer has a better time complexity, while the
β synchronizer has a better message complexity. The γ synchronizer is a mix of the
α and β synchronizers, combining the best of both worlds.
Let a basic algorithm run on the network. A process becomes safe in a pulse when
it knows that all the basic messages it sent in this pulse have reached their destination.
Each basic message is therefore acknowledged, and a process becomes safe in a pulse
as soon as all the basic messages it sent in this pulse have been acknowledged. A
process can move to the next pulse when all its neighbors have become safe in its
current pulse.
We note that often acknowledgments of messages come for free, since they may
be part of the underlying transport layer anyhow, as is the case in TCP. Therefore, we
take the liberty to ignore them in the analysis of the message overhead of Awerbuch’s
synchronizer.
α synchronizer
In the α synchronizer, when a process has received acknowledgments for all the basic
messages it sent in a pulse, it sends a safe message to its neighbors. When a process
p has received safe messages from all its neighbors in a pulse, it moves to the next
pulse. Namely, then all the basic messages sent by p’s neighbors in this pulse have
reached their destination, so in particular p must have received all basic messages for
this pulse.
In every pulse, the α synchronizer requires 2E safe messages. If the last process
to start a pulse does so at time t, then this process is guaranteed to receive acknowledgments
for its basic messages in this pulse no later than time t+2, so each neighbor
will receive a safe message no later than time t + 3. Hence, the time overhead is at
most three time units per pulse.
β synchronizer
The β synchronizer reduces the number of required safe messages. The key idea is
to include an initialization phase, in which a centralized wave algorithm from chapter
4 is employed to build a spanning tree of the network. The safe messages travel up
the tree to the root. When the root of the tree has received safe messages from all its
children, all processes have become safe, so that all processes can move to the next
pulse. Then next messages travel down the tree to start this next pulse.
To be more precise, when a nonroot has in a pulse received acknowledgments
for all the basic messages it sent in this pulse as well as safe messages from all its
children in the tree, it sends a safe message to its parent in the tree. When the root
11.2 Awerbuch’s synchronizer 103
of the tree has in a pulse received acknowledgments for all the basic messages it sent
as well as safe messages from all its children, or when a nonroot receives a next
message from its parent, it sends a next message to its children, and moves to the
next pulse.
In comparison to the α synchronizer, where 2E safe messages per pulse are sent,
the β synchronizer uses N − 1 safe and N − 1 next messages, since they are sent
only through tree edges. One penalty is the overhead of building a spanning tree to
start with. More important, the time overhead of the β synchronizer is more severe
than of the α synchronizer. If the last process to start a pulse does so at time t, then
this process is guaranteed to receive acknowledgments for its basic messages in this
pulse no later than time t+2. So if the spanning tree has depth k, the root will receive
a safe message from its children no later than time t + k +2, and each nonroot will
receive a next message from its parent no later than time t + 2k + 2. Hence, the
time overhead is at most 2k + 2 time units per pulse.
γ synchronizer
The γ synchronizer divides the network into clusters, and within each cluster a spanning
tree is built. Between each pair of neighboring clusters, that is, distinct clusters
that are connected by a channel, one of these connecting channels is selected as a
designated channel. Each pulse consists of three phases. First, the β synchronizer is
applied in each cluster to determine that all the processes in the cluster have become
safe. Next, clusters signal to each other via the designated channels that they contain
only safe processes, by means of the α synchronizer. Finally, within each cluster the
β synchronizer is used once more, to conclude that all neighboring clusters are safe,
so that all processes in the cluster can move to the next pulse.
As we said, each pulse, first the β synchronizer is applied within each cluster.
Note that a process must receive acknowledgments for all the basic messages it sent,
so also to neighbors outside its cluster, before it can become safe. When the next
messages of the β synchronizer travel down the tree within a cluster, the processes
do not immediately move to the next pulse. Instead, they send cluster-safe messages
into their designated channels. When a nonroot has received cluster-safe
messages through all its designated channels as well as from all its children, it sends
a cluster-safe message to its parent. When a root has received cluster-safe messages
through all its designated channels as well as from all its children, or when a
nonroot receives a cluster-next message from its parent, it sends a cluster-next
message to its children, and moves to the next pulse.
The message overhead of the γ synchronizer is:
• a safe, a next, a cluster-safe, and a cluster-next message through each tree
edge in any cluster, and
• two cluster-safe messages, one either way, through each designated channel.
Let the spanning trees of the clusters have depth at most ℓ. If the last process to
start a pulse does so at time t, then this process is guaranteed to receive acknowledgments
for its basic messages in this pulse no later than time t + 2. So each root will
104 11 Synchronous Networks
receive a safe message from its children no later than time t + ℓ + 2, and each nonroot
will receive a next message from its parent no later than time t+2ℓ+2. Then
cluster-safe messages through designated channels will reach their destination no
later than time t + 2ℓ + 3. So each root will receive a cluster-safe message from
its children (and through its designated channels) no later than time t + 3ℓ + 3, and
each nonroot will receive a cluster-next message from its parent no later than time
t + 4ℓ + 3. Hence, the time overhead is at most 4ℓ + 3 time units per pulse.
In conclusion, on one hand we want to have few clusters to minimize the number
of designated channels and thus reduce the message overhead. On the other hand, we
want the trees in the clusters to have a small depth to minimize the time overhead.
Example 11.1 The network below has been divided into three clusters. The dark
processes depict the roots, and the dark lines depict the tree edges and the designated
channels.
Since there are fifteen tree edges in total, and two designated channels, the message
overhead of the γ synchronizer in a pulse consists of sixty messages through the tree
edges plus four messages through the designated channels. The trees all have depth
one, that is, ℓ = 1, so the time overhead of the γ synchronizer is at most seven time
units per pulse.
Note that because the network has 36 channels, the α synchronizer would give
a message overhead of 72 safe messages per pulse. Furthermore, since a spanning
tree of the entire network has depth at least three, that is, k = 3, the β synchronizer
may give a time overhead of eight time units per pulse.
11.3 Bounded delay networks with local clocks 105
11.3 Bounded delay networks with local clocks
This section discusses a synchronizer for bounded delay networks, meaning that an
upper bound dmax is known on network latency; when a message is sent, it is guaranteed
to reach its destination within dmax time units.
Moreover, each process p is supposed to have a local clock Cp. A process can
read as well as adjust the value of its local clock. The time domain is R≥0, that is,
the nonnegative real numbers.We distinguish real time, meaning time progression in
the real world, from local clock times, which try to estimate real time. At real time
τ , the clock at p returns the value Cp(τ ). The local clocks are started at real time 0:
for all processes p, Cp(0) = 0.
Each local clock Cp is assumed to have ρ-bounded drift, for some ρ > 1, compared
to real time. That is, if τ2 ≥ τ1, then
1
ρ
(τ2 − τ1) ≤ Cp(τ2) − Cp(τ1) ≤ ρ(τ2 − τ1).
To build a synchronous system, the local clocks should moreover have precision
δ for some δ > 0. That is, at any time τ and for any pair of processes p, q:
|Cp(τ ) − Cq(τ )| ≤ δ.
Consider a bounded delay network, with local clocks that have ρ-bounded drift
and precision δ; we assume that upper bounds for ρ and δ are known. The synchronizer
is defined as follows: when a process reads the time
(i − 1)(ρ2δ + ρdmax)
at its local clock, it starts pulse i, for any i ≥ 1.
Theorem 11.1 The synchronizer for bounded delay networks, with local clocks that
have ρ-bounded drift and precision δ, is correct.
Proof. We must show that any process p is guaranteed to receive all its messages for
a pulse i ≥ 1 before starting pulse i+1. It suffices to prove that for all processes p, q
and all τ ,
C−1
q (τ) + dmax ≤ C−1
p (τ + ρ2δ + ρdmax)
(where C−1
r (τ ) is the first moment in real time that the clock of process r returns the
value τ ). Because taking τ = (i − 1)(ρ2δ + ρdmax), this implies that q starts pulse i
at least dmax time units before p starts pulse i+1. Since network latency is assumed
to be at most dmax, this assures that p receives the messages from q for pulse i in
time.
The desired inequality follows immediately from the following two inequalities:
C−1
q (τ ) ≤ C−1
p (τ + ρ2δ) (11.1)
C−1
p (τ) + υ ≤ C−1
p (τ + ρυ) (11.2)
106 11 Synchronous Networks
(In the first inequality, add a summand dmax at both sides; in the second inequality,
replace τ by τ +ρ2δ and υ by dmax.)We now set out to prove these two inequalities.
Consider the moment in time that q’s clock returns some value τ − δ, and let
real time progress for ρδ time units. Since q’s clock is ρ-bounded from below, in that
period q’s clock will progress with at least δ time units, so it will return a clock value
of at least τ . This can be depicted as follows:
real time
Cq
ρδ
τ − δ ≥ τ
In other words,
C−1
q (τ ) ≤ C−1
q (τ − δ) + ρδ.
Furthermore, since local clocks have precision δ,
C−1
q (τ − δ) ≤ C−1
p (τ ).
Combining these two inequalities, we conclude that for all τ ,
C−1
q (τ ) ≤ C−1
p (τ) + ρδ (11.3)
Now consider the moment in time that p’s clock returns some value τ , and let
real time progress for υ time units. Since p’s clock is ρ-bounded from above, in that
period p’s clock will progress with at most ρυ time units, so it will return a clock
value of at most τ + ρυ. This can be depicted as follows:
τ ≤ τ + ρυ
Cp
real time
υ
In other words, we have argued that inequality (11.2) holds. Furthermore, inequalities
(11.3) and (11.2), with υ = ρδ, together yield inequality (11.1). ⊓%
11.4 Election in anonymous rings with bounded expected delay
Bounded expected delay networks relax the restriction of bounded network latency
to a known upper bound on the expected network latency. This means that arbitrarily
long message delays are possible, but very long delays are less probable than short
delays. In this setting, for anonymous directed rings in which all processes know the
11.4 Election in anonymous rings with bounded expected delay 107
ring size N, a Las Vegas election algorithm exists with an average-case message and
time complexity of O(N). This shows that even mild synchrony restrictions can be
helpful for the development of efficient distributed algorithms.We recall that without
restrictions on the expected network latency, there is a lower bound O(N logN) for
the average-case message complexity of election algorithms on rings.
The election algorithm for anonymous directed rings with bounded expected delay,
which we refer to as the resuscitation algorithm, requires that processes have
clocks with ρ-bounded drift, for some ρ > 1. The algorithm starts, just as in the tree
election algorithm, with a wake-up phase, in which each initiator, and each noninitiator
when it is woken up, sends a wake-up message to its successor in the ring. After
sending this message, the process becomes idle. Each (awake) process can be in four
states: idle, active, passive, or leader.
Each process p maintains a counter np-hopsp, which estimates from below the
number of hops between p and its first nonpassive predecessor in the ring. Initially,
np-hopsp = 1 at all processes p. An idle process p at each clock tick (so every
moment its clock progresses one time unit) remains idle with some probability πp ∈
⟨0, 1⟩ and become active with probability 1− πp. When p becomes active, it sends a
message ⟨np-hops, 1⟩, where the argument provides the receiver with a safe value
for np-hops.
Let a message ⟨np-hops, h⟩ arrive at a process q. Then q performs the assignment
np-hopsq ← max{np-hopsq, h} and acts as follows, depending on its state.
• In case q is idle or passive, it sends ⟨np-hops, np-hopsq + 1⟩. And if q is idle,
then it becomes passive.
• In case q is active, either it becomes idle, if h < N, or it becomes the leader, if
h = N.
When a process q receives a message ⟨np-hops, h⟩ from its predecessor p, at
least the first h − 1 predecessors of q in the ring are passive. This can be seen by
induction on h: the case h = 1 is trivial, and if h > 1, then clearly p is passive,
and must have received a message ⟨np-hops, h − 1⟩ in the past, so by induction
the first h − 2 predecessors of p in the ring are also passive. Since np-hopsq stores
the maximum of all the messages q has received, at least the first np-hopsq − 1
predecessors of q in the ring are passive.
We discuss the correctness of the resuscitation algorithm. The number of messages
in transit always equals the number of active processes in the ring: initially,
both numbers are zero; processes that become active send a message; idle and passive
processes forward messages; and at arrival of a message, active processes become
nonactive and do not forward the message. Since only idle processes can become
passive, it follows that at the moment a message arrives, there must be an active process.
Active processes do not become passive at the arrival of a message, so there
is always a nonpassive process. Furthermore, when a process becomes active, there
is a positive probability that the message it sends will complete the round trip, after
which the process becomes the leader. And we have argued before that when a process
receives ⟨np-hops,N⟩, all other N − 1 processes must have become passive.
108 11 Synchronous Networks
To conclude, the resuscitation algorithm is a Las Vegas algorithm that terminates
with probability one.
Example 11.2 We consider one possible computation of the resuscitation algorithm
on an anonymous directed ring with processes p, q, r. At the first tick of their clocks,
all three processes happen to become active and send ⟨np-hops, 1⟩. Next, p and
q receive these messages from r and p, respectively, and both become idle. At the
next tick of its clock, p becomes active again and sends ⟨np-hops, 1⟩. This message
arrives at q, which becomes passive and sends ⟨np-hops, 2⟩. This message arrives
at r, which sets np-hopsr to 2 and becomes idle. Finally, the message ⟨np-hops, 1⟩ that q sent at the start of the computation arrives at r. As a result, r becomes passive
and sends ⟨np-hops, 3⟩ (because np-hopsr = 2). When this message arrives at p,
it becomes the leader.
The computation in this example shows that it is beneficial for the message complexity
that an idle or passive process r, at the arrival of a message ⟨np-hops, h⟩,
forwards ⟨np-hops, np-hopsr + 1⟩ instead of ⟨np-hops, h + 1⟩. Otherwise, at
the end of the computation in the example, r would not send ⟨np-hops, 3⟩ but
⟨np-hops, 2⟩ to p. Then p would have become idle, instead of the leader.
Key to the favorable average-case message complexity of the resuscitation algorithm
mentioned at the start of this section is a smart choice of the probability πp
with which an idle process p remains idle at a clock tick. This choice depends on the
number of idle processes in the ring; the more idle processes, the larger πp should be,
to maximize the chance that exactly one idle process becomes active, and its message
completes the round trip without any other idle process becoming active in the
meantime. Therefore, the initial value of πp depends on N, and πp decreases at every
increase of np-hopsp:
πp =
!
N − 1
N + 1
"np-hopsp
N .
We argue that these dynamic values of the πp yield an average-case message and
time complexity of O(N). For simplicity, we assume that local clocks are perfectly
synchronized with real time, that messages on average take exactly one time unit
to reach their destination, and that the values np-hopsp at nonpassive processes p
always equal the number of hops between p and its first nonpassive predecessor. The
forthcoming argumentation is somewhat more involved when clocks have ρ-bounded
drift, or np-hopsp may temporarily be smaller than the number of hops between p
and its first nonpassive predecessor.
Consider a clock tick at which all nonpassive processes are idle. By assumption,
the values of the parameters np-hopsp of the nonpassive processes p always add up
to N. Therefore, the probability that the idle processes all remain idle at this clock
tick, that is, the product of the πp of the idle processes p, is N−1
N+1. So the probability
that an idle process becomes active and sends a message at this clock tick is 2
N+1. By
assumption, a round trip of this message on average takes N time units. Therefore,
Exercises 109
the probability that another idle process becomes active during this round trip is at
most 1 − (N−1
N+1)N, which is at most 89
because N ≥ 2; so this probability has an
upper bound < 1 that is independent of the ring size. In conclusion, on average
once every O(N) time units an idle process becomes active, and with an average
probability of O(1) the message of this active process completes its round trip. These
two observations together imply that the average-case message and time complexity
of the resuscitation algorithm are O(N).
Bibliographical notes
Awerbuch’s synchronizer originates from [6]. Bounded delay networks were introduced
in [21], and a synchronizer for bounded delay networks with local clocks that
have bounded drift was presented in [76]. Expected bounded delay networks and the
resuscitation algorithm stem from [8].
Exercises
Exercise 11.1 Consider a network of processes p0, . . . , pN−1 on a line (so with diameter
N − 1). Let p0 initiate the simple synchronizer. Give an example where at
some point p0 is in pulse N − 1 while pN−2 is in pulse 1.

drift and precision δ, needs to be adapted. Argue that your adapted synchronizer is
correct.
Exercise 11.5 Suppose that the resuscitation algorithm would not start with a wakeup
phase, but instead initiators would be idle and noninitiators would be passive at the
start. Explain why then, in case of a single initiator, the average-case time complexity
would not be O(N).

Crash Failures
In practice, processes in a distributed system may crash, meaning that they stop executing
unexpectedly. In this chapter we consider how the rest of the system can
cope with a crash of one or more processes, if at all possible. The next chapter will
consider the more severe type of so-called Byzantine failures, where processes may
show behavior that is not in line with the specification of the distributed algorithm
that is being executed.
The problem of failures can be alleviated by including redundancy and replication
in the system, and letting processes negotiate before a certain action is taken. A
typical example is a database management system in which the processes collectively
decide whether to commit or abort a transaction.
The challenge we pose to the system is to let its processes agree on a single value,
even though some processes may have crashed. The (binary) consensus problem is
that the correct processes, that is, the processes that have not crashed (or, in the next
chapter, that are not Byzantine), must eventually uniformly decide for either 0 or 1. In
a crash consensus algorithm to solve this problem, each process randomly chooses an
initial value 0 or 1; so with N processes there are 2N different initial configurations.
In all executions of a crash consensus algorithm, each correct process should perform
one decide event, and the following three properties must be satisfied.
• Termination: every correct process eventually decides for either 0 or 1.
• Agreement: all correct processes decide for the same value.
• Validity: if all processes choose the same initial value, then all correct processes
decide for this value.
The validity requirement rules out trivial solutions where the processes always decide
for 0, or always decide for 1, irrespective of their initial values.
A reachable configuration of a crash consensus algorithm is called bivalent if
from this configuration one can reach a terminal configuration where consensus has
been reached on the value 0, as well as a terminal configuration where consensus
has been reached on the value 1. The validity requirement implies that each crash
consensus algorithm has a bivalent initial configuration; see exercise 12.1.
112 12 Crash Failures
A k-crash consensus algorithm, for a k > 0, is a crash consensus algorithm that
can cope with up to k crashing processes. A basic assumption we make is that the
network topology is complete. This guarantees that the network topology always
stays strongly connected, even when processes have crashed.
12.1 Impossibility of 1-crash consensus
In this section, we assume that processes cannot observe whether some process has
crashed. If a process does not send messages for a very long time, this may simply
be because the process or its outgoing channels are very slow. It turns out that in this
setting one cannot hope to develop a terminating 1-crash consensus algorithm. It does
not matter how large the network is, the prospect of one crashing process suffices to
yield infinite executions in which no decision is ever made. The basic idea behind this
impossibility result is that a decision for either 0 or 1, in an asynchronous setting,
must be enforced by an event at a single process. But what if this process crashes
immediately after this event, and in case of a send event, the message travels through
the channel for a very long, indefinite amount of time? Then at some moment in
time the remaining processes should organize themselves to mimic the decision of
the crashed process, but without any input from this crashed process. This is shown
to be impossible, if crashes cannot be observed.
Theorem 12.1 There is no terminating algorithm for 1-crash consensus.
Proof. Consider any 1-crash consensus algorithm. Let γ be a bivalent configuration.
Then γ → γ0 and γ → γ1, where γ0 can lead to decision 0 and γ1 to decision 1. We
argue that γ0 or γ1 must be bivalent. We distinguish two cases.
• The transitions γ → γ0 and γ → γ1 correspond to events e0 and e1 at different
processes p0 and p1, respectively. Then in γ0 the event e1 at p1 can still be performed,
and likewise in γ1 the event e0 at p0 can still be performed. Performing
e1 at p1 in γ0 and performing e0 at p0 in γ1 lead to the same configuration δ, because
in both cases the resulting configuration is reached from γ by performing
the concurrent events e0 and e1 at p0 and p1. So there are transitions γ0 → δ and
γ1 → δ. Hence, γ0 or γ1 is bivalent, if δ can lead to a decision 1 or 0, respectively.
• The transitions γ → γ0 and γ → γ1 correspond to events at the same process p.
In γ, p can crash. Moreover, the messages sent by p can take indefinitely long to
reach their destination. Therefore, in γ the processes except p must be b-potent
for some b ∈ {0, 1}. In a configuration, a set S of processes is said to be b-potent
if by executing only events at processes in S, some process in S can decide for b.
In γ0 and γ1 the processes except p are clearly still b-potent. So γ1−b is bivalent.
In conclusion, a bivalent configuration can always make a transition to some bivalent
configuration. Since the crash consensus algorithm has a bivalent initial configuration,
there is an infinite execution, visiting only bivalent configurations. ⊓$
We can even construct an infinite execution that is fair; see exercise 12.3.

12.2 Bracha-Toueg crash consensus algorithm
In chapter 10, to circumvent the impossibility of a terminating election algorithm
for anonymous networks, we moved to probabilistic algorithms. Here we follow the
same approach. First we discuss another impossibility result: there is no Las Vegas
algorithm for crash consensus if half of the processes can crash. Namely, then the
network can be divided into two disjoint halves, where in each half the processes do
not receive messages from the processes in the other half for a very long time, so that
they must act under the assumption that the processes in the other half have crashed.
As a result, the two halves may act as independent entities, that can come to different
decisions.
Theorem 12.2 Let k ≥ N2
. There is no Las Vegas algorithm for k-crash consensus.
Proof. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that such an algorithm does exist. Divide the
processes into two disjoint sets S and T, which both contain at most ⌈N2
⌉ processes.
Since k ≥ ⌈N2
⌉, the processes in S must be able to come to a decision by themselves,
in case all processes in T have crashed. In other words, S is always 0-potent
or 1-potent. Likewise, T is always 0-potent or 1-potent. In each reachable configuration,
S and T should be either both 0-potent or both 1-potent. For otherwise they
could independently decide for different values, because they are disjoint sets.
Consider a bivalent initial configuration γ. There must be a configuration δ reachable
from γ, and a transition δ → δ′, with S and T both only b-potent in δ and only
(1−b)-potent in δ′, for some b ∈ {0, 1}. Since this transition would correspond to a
single event, at a process in either S or T, clearly such a transition cannot exist. ⊓(
If k < N2
, then a Las Vegas algorithm for k-crash consensus does exist. The
Bracha-Toueg k-crash consensus algorithm, for k < N2
, progresses in rounds. Initially,
at the start of round 0, each process randomly chooses a value 0 or 1. The
weight of a process, holding value b ∈ {0, 1}, approximates from below the number
of processes that voted b in the previous round. In round 0, each process has weight
1.
In each round n ≥ 0, each correct, undecided process p sends its value and
weight to all processes, and determines a new value and weight, based on the first
N − k messages it receives in this round:
• p sends ⟨n, valuep, weightp⟩ to all processes (including itself).
• p waits until N − k messages ⟨n, b,w⟩ have arrived. (It purges/stores messages
from earlier/future rounds.)
– Ifw > N2
for an incoming message ⟨n, b,w⟩, then valuep ← b.
Otherwise, valuep ← 0 if most messages voted 0, or else valuep ← 1.
– weightp is changed into the number of incoming votes for valuep in round n.
• Ifw > N2
for more than k incoming messages ⟨n, b,w⟩, then p decides for b.
If p decides for b in round n, it broadcasts ⟨n+1, b,N −k⟩ and ⟨n+2, b,N −k⟩, and
terminates. This suffices because when a process decides, all other correct processes
are guaranteed to decide within two rounds; see the proof of theorem 12.3.
114 12 Crash Failures
In reality, p does not send messages to itself, but can simply include a message it
broadcasts in the collection of messages it receives from other processes in the same
round. Note that if p waited for more than N − k messages ⟨n, b,w⟩ in a round n,
then a deadlock could occur, in case k processes have crashed. Note also that if p
receives messages ⟨n, b,w⟩ and ⟨n, 1 − b,w′⟩, then w + w′ ≤ N, so that w and w′
cannot both be greater than N2
. Note, finally, that since p waits for N − k messages
⟨n, b,w⟩ and can decide only if more than k of those messages have a weight greater
than N2
, it is essential that N −k > k.
Example 12.1 Given a network of three processes p, q, r, and k = 1. Each round a
process requires two incoming messages to determine a new value and weight, and
two b-votes with weight 2 to decide for b. We consider one possible computation of
the Bracha-Toueg 1-crash consensus algorithm on this network.
– Initially, p and q randomly choose the value 0 and r the value 1, all three with
weight 1.
– In round 0, p takes into account the messages from p and r; it sets its value to 1,
and its weight to 1. Moreover, q and r both take into account the messages from
p and q; they set their value to 0, and their weight to 2.
– In round 1, q takes into account the messages from q and r; since both messages
carry weight 2, it decides for 0. Moreover, p and r both take into account the
messages from p and r; since the message from r carries weight 2, they set their
value to 0, and their weight to 1.
p
q
r
decides for 0
value = 0
weight = 1 weight = 1
value = 0
– At the start of round 2, q crashes. So p and r can take into account only the
messages from p and r; as a result, they set their value to 0, and their weight to
2.
– In round 3, p and r can again only take into account the messages from p and r;
since both messages carry weight 2, they decide for 0.
– p and r send messages with value 0 and weight 2 for two more rounds, and
terminate.
Theorem 12.3 If scheduling of messages is fair, then the Bracha-Toueg k-crash consensus
algorithm, for any k < N2
, is a Las Vegas algorithm that terminates with
probability one.
Proof. First we prove that processes cannot decide for different values. Then we
prove that the algorithm terminates with probability one, under the assumption that
12.3 Failure detectors 115
scheduling of messages is fair, meaning that each possible order of delivery of the
messages in a round occurs with a positive probability.
Suppose a process p decides for a value b at the end of a round n. Then at the start
of round n, valueq = b and weightq > N2
for more than k processes q. Since in every
round, each correct, undecided process ignores messages from only k processes, in
round n these processes all take into account a message ⟨q, b,w⟩ withw > N2
. So in
round n+1, all correct processes vote b. So in round n+2, all correct processes vote
b with weight N − k. Hence, after round n + 2, all correct processes have decided
for b. To conclude, all correct processes decide for the same value.
Due to fair scheduling, in each round there is a positive probability that all processes
receive the first N − k messages from the same N − k processes. After such
a round n, all correct processes have the same value b. Then after round n + 1, all
correct processes have the value b with weight N − k. And after round n + 2, all
correct processes have decided for b. In conclusion, the algorithm terminates with
probability one. ⊓%
12.3 Failure detectors
The impossibility result in theorem 12.1, namely that there is no terminating 1-crash
consensus algorithm, assumes that crashes of processes cannot be observed. In the
next section we will see that this is a crucial assumption: when crashes can be detected,
there does exist a terminating k-crash consensus algorithm, if k < N2
. In the
current section, we discuss the notion of failure detectors, their properties, and two
straightforward implementations with different properties.
As time domain we take R≥0. Each execution of a crash consensus algorithm
is provided with a failure pattern, consisting of sets F(τ ) that contain the crashed
processes at time τ . Crashed processes cannot restart: τ0 ≤ τ1 ⇒ F(τ0) ⊆ F(τ1). It
is assumed that processes cannot observe F(τ ).
Processes carry a failure detector, to try to detect crashed processes.WithH(p, τ )
we denote the set of processes that are suspected to be crashed by (the failure detector
of) process p at time τ . Each execution of a crash consensus algorithm is provided
with a failure detector history H. In general, such suspicions may turn out be false,
typically because at a time τ a process p receives a message from a suspected process
q ∈ H(p, τ ). However, we require that failure detectors are always complete: from
some time onward, every crashed process is suspected by every correct process.
A failure detector is called strongly accurate if only crashed processes are ever
suspected. In bounded delay networks, a strongly accurate (and complete) failure
detector can be implemented as follows. Suppose dmax is a known upper bound
on network latency. Let each process broadcast a message alive every ν time units.
Each process from which no message is received for ν+dmax time units has crashed.
Since crashed processes stop sending alive messages, the failure detector is clearly
complete. And the bound on network latency ensures that there can never be more
than ν+dmax time units between the arrival at p of subsequent alive messages from
q, so the failure detector is strongly accurate.
116 12 Crash Failures
A failure detector is called eventually strongly accurate if from some point in
time onward, only crashed processes are suspected. Suppose there is an unknown
upper bound on network delay. Again, let each process broadcast a message alive
every ν time units. An eventually strongly accurate (and complete) failure detector
can be implemented as follows. Each process p initially guesses as network latency
dp = 1. If p does not receive a message from a process q for ν + dp time units, then
p suspects that q has crashed. This suspicion may be false, in case the value dp is
too conservative. When p receives a message from a suspected process q, then q is
no longer suspected by p, and dp ← dp + 1. Since crashed processes stop sending
alive messages, the failure detector is clearly complete. And since network latency
is bounded, each process p can only finitely many times receive a message from a
suspected process and as a result increase dp. This guarantees that the failure detector
is eventually strongly accurate.
12.4 Consensus with a weakly accurate failure detector
A failure detector is called weakly accurate if some correct process is never suspected
by any process. In the presence of a weakly accurate failure detector, there is a simple
k-crash consensus algorithm for any k.
Let the processes be numbered: p0, . . . , pN−1. Initially, each process randomly
chooses a value 0 or 1. The crash consensus algorithm proceeds in rounds n =
0, . . . , N − 1. In a round n, the process pn acts as the coordinator:
• pn (if not crashed) broadcasts its value.
• Each process waits:
– either for an incoming message from pn, in which case it adopts the value of pn;
– or until it suspects that pn has crashed.
After round N − 1, each correct process decides for its value at that time.
This rotating coordinator algorithm is a k-crash consensus algorithm for anyk <
N. Since the failure detector is weakly accurate, some correct process pi is never
suspected by any process. This implies that after round i, all correct processes have
the same value b. Then clearly in the rounds i+1, . . . , N −1, all processes keep this
value b. Hence, after round N − 1, all correct processes decide for b.
12.5 Chandra-Toueg algorithm
With an eventually strongly accurate failure detector, the proof of theorem 12.2,
that there is no Las Vegas algorithm for k-crash consensus if k ≥ N2
, still applies.
Namely, it could take a very long, indefinite period of time before the failure detector
becomes strongly accurate, and up to that point there can still be false suspicions.
Theorem 12.4 Let k ≥ N2
. There is no Las Vegas algorithm for k-crash consensus
based on an eventually strongly accurate failure detector.
12.5 Chandra-Toueg algorithm 117
Proof. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that such an algorithm does exist. Divide the
processes into two disjoint sets S and T, which both contain at most ⌈N2
⌉ processes.
Since k ≥ ⌈N2
⌉, the processes in S are able to come to a decision by themselves,
as they must be able to cope if all processes in T have crashed. In other words, S
is always 0-potent or 1-potent. Likewise, T is always 0-potent or 1-potent. In each
reachable configuration, S and T should be either both 0-potent or both 1-potent,
for otherwise they could independently decide for different values. Namely, since the
failure detector is only eventually strongly accurate, the processes in S (or T) may
suspect for a very long period of time that the processes in T (respectively S) have
crashed, and at some point have to come to a decision by themselves.
Consider a bivalent initial configuration γ. Then there must be a configuration δ
reachable from γ, and a transition δ → δ′, with S and T both only b-potent in δ and
only (1−b)-potent in δ′, for some b ∈ {0, 1}. Since this transition would correspond
to a single event, at a process in either S or T, clearly such a transition cannot exist.
⊓(
A failure detector is called eventually weakly accurate if from some point in time
on, some correct process is never suspected by any process. The Chandra-Toueg
crash consensus algorithm, which uses an eventually weakly accurate failure detector,
is an always correctly terminating k-crash consensus algorithm for any k < N2
.
Let the processes be numbered: p0, . . . , pN−1. Initially, each process randomly
chooses a value 0 or 1. The algorithm proceeds in rounds. Each process q records
the number of the last round last -updateq in which it updated its value; initially,
last -updateq = −1.
Each round n ≥ 0 is coordinated by the process pc with c = n mod N. Round
n progresses as follows.
• Every correct, undecided process q (including pc) sends to pc the message
⟨vote, n, valueq, last -updateq⟩.
• pc (if not crashed and undecided) waits until N − k such messages have arrived,
selects one, say ⟨vote, n, b, ℓ⟩, with ℓ as large as possible, and broadcasts
⟨value, n, b⟩.
• Every correct, undecided process q (including pc) waits either:
– until ⟨value, n, b⟩ arrives; then it performs valueq ← b and last -updateq ← n,
and sends ⟨ack, n⟩ to pc;
– or until it suspects that pc has crashed; then it sends ⟨nack, n⟩ to pc.
• pc waits for N − k acknowledgments. If more than k of them are positive, then
pc decides for b, broadcasts ⟨decide, b⟩, and terminates.
A correct, undecided process that receives ⟨decide, b⟩, decides for b and terminates.
The idea behind the decision criterion for the coordinator in a round n, the reception
of more than k positive acknowledgments, is that then more than k processes
have adopted the value b of the coordinator and set their last -update parameter to n.
Since in each round the coordinator ignores messages of only k processes and adopts
the value from a message with a maximal last -update, this guarantees that in future
rounds coordinators will always adopt the value b.
118 12 Crash Failures
Example 12.2 Given a complete network of three processes p0, p1, p2, and k = 1.
Each round the coordinator waits for two incoming votes, and needs two positive
acknowledgments to decide. We consider one possible computation of the Chandra-
Toueg 1-crash consensus algorithm on this network.
– Initially, p0 and p2 randomly choose the value 1 and p1 the value 0; last -update =
−1 at all three processes.
– In round 0, the coordinator p0 takes into account the messages from p0 and p1,
selects the message from p1 to determine its new value, and broadcasts the value
0. When p0 and p1 receive this message, they set their value to 0 and last -update
to 0, and send ack to p0; moreover, p1 moves to round 1. However, p2 moves
to round 1 without waiting for a message from p0, because its failure detector
falsely suspects that p0 has crashed; p2 sends nack to p0, and moves to round
1. The coordinator p0 receives the ack’s of p0 and p1, decides for 0, and crashes
before it can broadcast a decide message.
p0
p1
p2
value = 1
and crashed last-update = −1
decided for 0
last-update = 0
value = 0
– In round 1, the coordinator p1 can take into account only the messages from p1
and p2. It must select the message from p1 to determine its new value, because it
has the highest last -update. So p1 broadcasts the value 0. When p1 receives this
message, it sets its value to 0 and last -update to 1, and sends ack to itself. The
process p2 moves to round 2 without waiting for a message from p1, because
its failure detector falsely suspects that p1 has crashed; p2 sends nack to p0,
and moves to round 2. After p1 has received the ack and nack from p1 and p2,
respectively, it also moves to round 2.
p0

last-update = −1

– In round 2, the coordinator p2 can take into account only the messages from p1
and p2. It must select the message from p1 to determine its new value, because
it has the highest last -update. So p2 broadcasts the value 0. When p1 and p2
receive this message, they set their value to 0 and last -update to 2, and send
ack to p2; moreover, p1 moves to round 3. The coordinator p2 receives the ack’s
of p1 and p2, decides for 0, and broadcasts ⟨decide, 0⟩. When p1 receives this
message, it also decides for 0.
Exercises 119
Theorem 12.5 In the presence of an eventually weakly accurate failure detector, the
Chandra-Toueg algorithm is an (always correctly terminating) k-crash consensus
algorithm for any k < N2
.
Proof. First we prove that processes cannot decide for different values. Then we
prove that the algorithm always terminates.
Let round n be the first round in which the coordinator decides for a value, say
b. Then the coordinator received more than k ack’s in this round, so that:
(1) there are more than k processes q with last -updateq ≥ n, and
(2) last -updateq ≥ n implies valueq = b.
We argue, by induction on m − n, that properties (1) and (2) are preserved in all
roundsm > n. In round m, since the coordinator ignores votes of only k processes,
by (1) it takes into account at least one vote with last -update ≥ n to determine
its new value. Hence, by (2), the coordinator of round m sets its value to b, and
broadcasts ⟨value, m, b⟩. To conclude, from round n onward, processes can decide
only for b.
Now we argue that eventually some correct process will decide. Since the failure
detector is eventually weakly accurate, from some round onward, some correct process
p will never be suspected. So in the next round where p is the coordinator, all
correct processes will wait for a value message from p. Therefore, p will receive at
least N − k ack’s, and since N −k > k, it will decide. All correct processes will
eventually receive the decide message of p and will also decide. ⊓&

Byzantine Failures
In this chapter we consider Byzantine failures, meaning that a process may start to
show behavior that is not in line with the specification of the distributed algorithm
that is being executed. The class of Byzantine failures includes crash failures. We
assume that Byzantine failures can in general not be observed, and that processes are
either correct or Byzantine from the start.
Again, the challenge we pose to the system is to let its correct processes, that is,
the processes that are not Byzantine, agree on a value 0 or 1. The network topology
is still assumed to be complete.
In a (binary) Byzantine consensus algorithm, each correct process randomly
chooses an initial value 0 or 1. In all executions of a Byzantine consensus algorithm,
each correct process should perform exactly one decide event. The properties
termination and agreement mentioned at the start of chapter 12 must be satisfied,
together with a slightly strengthened version of validity.
• Validity: if all correct processes choose the same initial value, then all correct
processes decide for this value.
Similar to the case of crash consensus, the validity requirement implies that each
Byzantine consensus algorithm has a bivalent initial configuration.
A k-Byzantine consensus algorithm, for a k > 0, is a Byzantine consensus algorithm
that can cope with up to k Byzantine processes.
13.1 Bracha-Toueg Byzantine consensus algorithm
With Byzantine failures, fewer incorrect processes can be allowed than in the case of
crashing processes, if one wants to achieve a Las Vegas consensus algorithm. A k-
Byzantine consensus algorithm is possible only if k < N3
. The reason is that correct
processes must be able to cope with k Byzantine processes, which may not cast a
vote. So they can collect votes from at most N − k processes, as else a deadlock
could occur. Among these N − k processes, k could be Byzantine. Only if k < N3
,
122 13 Byzantine Failures
it is guaranteed that the (in the worst case) N − 2k votes from correct processes
outnumber the k votes from Byzantine processes.
Theorem 13.1 Let k ≥ N3
. There is no Las Vegas algorithm for k-Byzantine consensus.
Proof. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that such an algorithm does exist. Since
k ≥ ⌈N3
⌉, the processes can be divided into two sets S and T that both contain
N − k processes, while S ∩ T contains at most k processes.
Since S contains N − k elements, the processes in S must be able to come to a
decision by themselves, in case all processes outside S are Byzantine. In other words,
S is always 0-potent or 1-potent. Likewise, T is always 0-potent or 1-potent. In each
reachable configuration, S and T should be either both 0-potent or both 1-potent,
for else they could independently decide for different values. Namely, the processes
in S ∩ T could all be Byzantine, and could therefore be free to participate in an
execution leading to a decision for b with the processes in S, while participating in
an execution leading to a decision for 1 − b with the processes in T.
Consider a bivalent initial configuration γ. Then there must be a configuration δ
reachable from γ, and a transition δ → δ′, with S and T both only b-potent in δ and
only (1−b)-potent in δ′, for some b ∈ {0, 1}. Since this transition would correspond
to a single event, at a process in either S or T, clearly such a transition cannot exist.
⊓)
If k < N3
, then a Las Vegas algorithm for k-Byzantine consensus does exist.
The Bracha-Toueg k-Byzantine consensus algorithm works as follows. The algorithm
progresses in rounds. Just as in the Bracha-Toueg crash consensus algorithm,
in each round, every correct, undecided process sends its value to all processes,
and determines a new value, based on the first N − k messages it receives in this
round: the new value is 0 if most messages voted 0, and 1 otherwise. A process p decides
for b if in a round it receives more than N+k
2 b-votes; note that by assumption
N+k
2 < N − k. Then p broadcasts ⟨decide, b⟩ and terminates. The other processes
interpret ⟨decide, b⟩ as a b-vote by p for all rounds to come. Note that they cannot
simply decide for b at the reception of this message, since p might be Byzantine. This
completes the informal description of the algorithm, except for a verification phase
of votes.
The example below shows that this algorithm would be flawed if in a round two
correct processes could accept different votes from a Byzantine process.
Example 13.1 Given a network of four processes p, q, r, s, and k = 1. Suppose
that q is Byzantine. We consider one possible computation of the Bracha-Toueg 1-
Byzantine consensus algorithm. Each round, a correct process waits for three votes,
and needs three b-votes to decide for b. Initially, p and s randomly choose the value
1 and r the value 0.
– In round 0, p, r, and s broadcast their value, while q sends a 0-vote to p and r,
and a 1-vote to s. Next, p and r take into account a 1-vote by p and 0-votes by q
13.1 Bracha-Toueg Byzantine consensus algorithm 123
and r, and set their value to 0. Furthermore, s takes into account 1-votes by p, q,
and s, decides for 1, and broadcasts ⟨decide, 1⟩.
– In round 1, p and r broadcast their value, while q broadcasts a 0-vote. Next, p
and r take into account 0-votes by p, q, and r, and decide for 0. So we have
inconsistent decisions.
The cause for the inconsistent decisions in example 13.1 is that in round 0, p and
r use a 0-vote from q while s uses a 1-vote from q, which can happen because q is
Byzantine. To avoid this mishap, the Bracha-Toueg Byzantine consensus algorithm
includes a verification phase of votes. When a process p receives a b-vote from a
process q, p does not accept this vote straightaway. Instead, p echoes this vote to all
processes, and it accepts a b-vote by q only if it receives an echo of a b-vote by q in
this round from more than N+k
2 processes. This guarantees that the correct processes
in a round never accept different votes from the same process, even if that process is
Byzantine.
As we said before, a process decides for b if it accepts more than N+k
2 b-votes
in a round. Since N+k
2 = N−k
2 + k, each correct processes then will find that more
than N−k
2 of the first N − k votes it accepts in this round are b-votes. So at the end
of this round all correct processes will take on the value b, and hence will continue
to do so for all future rounds.
We now give a more precise description of the Bracha-Toueg k-Byzantine consensus
algorithm. Initially, each correct process randomly chooses a value 0 or 1. In
each round n ≥ 0, each correct, undecided process p acts as follows:
• p sends ⟨vote, n, valuep⟩ to all processes (including itself).
• When p receives ⟨vote, m, b⟩ from a process q, it sends ⟨echo, q, m, b⟩ to all
processes (including itself).
• p stores incoming messages ⟨vote, m, b⟩ and ⟨echo, q, m, b⟩ with m > n for
future rounds.
• p counts incoming messages ⟨echo, q, n, b⟩ for each pair q, b. When more than
N+k
2 such messages have arrived, p accepts a b-vote by q.
• The round is completed when p has accepted votes from N−k processes. If most
votes are for 0, then valuep ← 0. Otherwise, valuep ← 1.
• If more than N+k
2 of the accepted votes are for b, then p decides for b, broadcasts
⟨decide, b⟩, and terminates.
The other processes interpret ⟨decide, b⟩ as a b-vote by p, and a b-echo by p for each
q, for all rounds to come.
Processes keep track whether multiple messages ⟨vote, m, ⟩ or ⟨echo, q, m, ⟩ arrive via the same channel; the sender must be Byzantine. To avoid miscounts, only
the first of these messages is taken into account.
Theorem 13.2 If scheduling of messages is fair, then the Bracha-Toueg k-Byzantine
consensus algorithm, for any k < N3
, is a Las Vegas algorithm that terminates with
probability one.
124 13 Byzantine Failures
Proof. First we prove that processes cannot decide for different values. Then we
prove that the algorithm terminates with probability one, under the assumption that
scheduling of messages is fair.
Each round, the correct processes eventually accept N − k votes, since there are
at least N − k correct processes which faithfully confirm each other’s votes, and by
assumption N −k > N+k
2 .
In a round n, let correct processes p and q accept votes for b and b′, respectively,
from a process r. Then p and q received more than N+k
2 messages ⟨echo, r, n, b⟩ and
⟨echo, r, n, b′⟩, respectively. More than k processes, so at least one correct process,
sent such messages to both p and q. This implies that b = b′.
Suppose a correct process p decides for b at the end of a round n, meaning that p
accepted more than N+k
2 b-votes. In every round, each correct process ignores votes
from only k processes, and we argued earlier that two correct processes never accept
different values from the same process. So since p accepted more than N+k
2 b-votes
in round n, all correct processes will accept more than N+k
2 − k = N−k
2 b-votes
in round n. Hence, after round n, all correct processes will have the value b. As a
consequence, every correct process will vote b in each round m > n, because in
each round m ≥ n it accepts at least N − 2k > N−k
2 b-votes. This implies that
correct processes cannot decide for different values.
Let S be a set of N − k correct processes. Due to fair scheduling, in each round
there is a probability ρ > 0 that each process in S accepts N − k votes from the
processes in S.With probability ρ2 this happens in consecutive rounds n, n+1. After
round n, all processes in S have the same value b. After round n+1, all processes in S
have decided for b, and broadcast ⟨decide, b⟩. To conclude, the algorithm terminates
with probability one. ⊓&
Example 13.2 We revisit example 13.1, but now taking into account the verification
phase of votes. Given a network of four processes p, q, r, s, and k = 1. Suppose
that q is Byzantine. We consider one possible computation of the Bracha-Toueg 1-
Byzantine consensus algorithm on this network. Each round, a correct process needs
three confirming echoes to accept a vote, three accepted votes to complete the round,
and three accepted b-votes to decide for b. Initially, p and s randomly choose the
value 1 and r the value 0. In the pictures of the consecutive rounds, for every process
two accepted votes from other processes and its own value in that round are depicted,
which are used to determine the value of that process in the next round.
– In round 0, p and r accept a 1-vote by p and 0-votes by q and r, because they get
confirmations for these votes from p, q, r. As a result, they set their value to 0.
Furthermore, s accepts 1-votes by p and s, because it gets confirmations for these
votes from p, r, s. However, s does not accept a 1-vote by q, because it receives
only two confirmations, from q and s. In the end, s accepts a 0-vote by r, for
which it gets confirmations from p, r, s, and sets its value to 1.

broadcasts ⟨decide, 0⟩. On the other hand, p accepts a 1-vote by s, because it
gets confirmations for these votes from p, r, s, and sets its value to 0. Once again,
s does not accept a 1-vote by q, because it receives only two confirmations, from
q and s. Instead, s accepts 0-votes by p and r, and a 1-vote by s, because it gets
confirmations for these votes from p, r, s. As a result, s sets its value to 0.

complete this computation swiftly, we let ⟨decide, 0⟩ arrive at p and s, and in
round 2 we let p and s accept each other’s 0-vote, so that they decide for 0.

13.2 Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer
In this section we revisit bounded delay networks, in which there is an upper bound
dmax on network latency; processes carry a local clock with ρ-bounded drift for some
ρ > 1 (see section 11.3). It is shown that even in the presence of Byzantine processes,
126 13 Byzantine Failures
local clocks can be synchronized regularly so that they have a precision δ > 0: at
any time τ and for any pair of processes p, q, |Cp(τ ) − Cq(τ )| ≤ δ.
First, it is shown that such a clock synchronization algorithm is possible only if
fewer than one-third of the processes are Byzantine.
Theorem 13.3 Let k ≥ N3
. There is no k-Byzantine clock synchronization algorithm.
Proof. Suppose we want to achieve clock synchronization so that the local clocks
have precision δ > 0. Consider a network of three processes p, q, r, where r is
Byzantine, and let k = 1. (The following computation can be easily extended to
general N and k ≥ N3
; see exercise 13.4.)
Let the clock of p run faster than the clock of q. Suppose a synchronization takes
place at real time τ , in which r sends Cp(τ) + δ to p, and Cq(τ ) − δ to q. Since r
reports a clock value to p that is within δ of p’s local clock value, and since p receives
only one other clock value (from q), p cannot recognize that r is Byzantine. Likewise,
q cannot recognize that r is Byzantine. So p and q have to stay within range δ of the
value reported by r, meaning that p cannot decrease and q cannot increase its clock
value.
By repeating this scenario at each synchronization round, the clock values of p
and q get further and further apart. So eventually, p will have to choose whether its
clock stays within range δ of q’s or r’s clock, without being able to determine which
of the two processes is Byzantine. And likewise for q. ⊓%
If at most k < N3
processes are Byzantine, then clock synchronization can be
achieved. To simplify the forthcoming presentation of Byzantine clock synchronization,
we take the bound dmax on network latency to be zero. (In a sense, we assume
that dmax is negligible compared to δ.)
In the Mahaney-Schneider k-Byzantine clock synchronization algorithm, processes
regularly communicate their clock values to each other, and each process takes
the average of all these clock values, whereby clock values that are provably from
Byzantine processes are discarded. It is assumed that at the start of a clock synchronization,
the local clocks have precision δ > 0. This algorithm achieves that after a
clock synchronization, the local clocks have precision 23
δ.
The Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer proceeds in synchronization rounds, in
which each correct process:
• collects the clock values of all processes,
• discards those reported values τ for which fewer than N − k processes report a
value in the interval [τ − δ, τ + δ] (they are from Byzantine processes),
• replaces all discarded and nonreceived values by an accepted value, and
• takes the average of these N values as its new clock value.
Theorem 13.4 The Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer is a k-Byzantine clock synchronization
algorithm for any k < N3
.
13.3 Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm 127
Proof. First we argue that if in some synchronization round, values ap and aq are
accepted at correct processes p and q, respectively, then
|ap − aq| ≤ 2δ.
In this synchronization round, at least N − k processes reported a value in [ap − δ, ap + δ] to p, and at least N − k processes reported a value in [aq − δ, aq + δ] to q.
Since N −2k > k, this implies that at least one correct process r reported a value in
[ap − δ, ap + δ] to p, and in [aq − δ, aq + δ] to q. Since r reports the same value to p
and q, it follows that |ap − aq| ≤ 2δ.
In some synchronization round, let the correct processes p and q accept from (or
assign to) each process r a value apr and aqr, respectively. Then p and q compute as
new clock value 1N
(
!
processes r apr) and 1N
(
!
processes r aqr), respectively.
By the argument above, for all processes r, |apr −aqr| ≤ 2δ. And apr = aqr for
all correct processes r. Hence,

In the proof of theorem 13.4 it was shown that after a synchronization round,
the clocks at correct processes have a precision smaller than 23δ. If the local clocks
have been synchronized at time τ , then due to ρ-bounded drift of local clocks, if no
synchronization takes place in the time interval [τ, τ + R]:
|Cp(τ + R) − Cq(τ + R)| <

So to achieve precision δ, a synchronization of local clocks should be performed

13.3 Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm
To cope with crash failures, failure detectors were introduced in section 12.3 to try
to detect crashed processes. The two implementations of failure detectors that we
discussed were both based on the absence of messages from a crashed process over
a certain period of time. Detecting Byzantine processes is much more complicated,
since they can keep on sending messages, and in general it is far from easy to determine
that a process is performing events that are not in line with the specification
of the distributed algorithm that is being executed. Therefore, to cope with Byzantine
processes, another strategy is followed: the network must be transformed into a
synchronous system.
In this section and the next we consider a variation on the Byzantine consensus
problem, called Byzantine broadcast, in the setting of synchronous networks. One
process, called the general, randomly chooses an initial value 0 or 1. The other processes,
called lieutenants, know who is the general. In each execution of a (binary)
Byzantine broadcast algorithm, the requirements termination and agreement must be
satisfied, together with a variation on validity.
128 13 Byzantine Failures
• Dependence: if the general is correct, then it decides for its own initial value.
A k-Byzantine broadcast algorithm can cope with at most k Byzantine processes. It
will come as no surprise that for k ≥ N3
such an algorithm does not exist, even if we
have a synchronous network.
Theorem 13.5 Let k ≥ N3
. There is no k-Byzantine broadcast algorithm for synchronous
networks.
Proof. Suppose toward a contradiction that a k-Byzantine broadcast algorithm for
synchronous networks does exist. Divide the processes into three disjoint sets S, T,
and U, with each at most k elements. Let the general be in S. We consider three
different scenarios, which are depicted here.

S Byzantine

T 1
In the first scenario at the left, the processes in U are Byzantine, and the general
starts with the value 0. The processes in S and T propagate 0. Moreover, all processes
in S ∪ T should decide for 0. The Byzantine processes in U, however, propagate 1
to the processes in T.
In the second scenario in the middle, the processes in T are Byzantine, and the
general starts with the value 1. The processes in S and U propagate 1. Moreover,
all processes in S ∪ U should decide for 1. The Byzantine processes in T, however,
propagate 0 to the processes in U.
In the third scenario at the right, the processes in S, including the general, are
Byzantine. The processes in S propagate 0 to T, and as a result the processes in T do
so too. Likewise, the processes in S propagate 1 to U, and as a result the processes in
U do so too. Note that the inputs of the processes in T agree with the first scenario,
so they all decide for 0. By contrast, the inputs of the processes in U agree with the
second scenario, so they all decide for 1. This is a contradiction. ⊓$
The Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm for synchronous networks is
a k-Byzantine broadcast algorithm for any k < N3
. Since the algorithm contains
recursive calls to itself, we denote it with Broadcastg(N, k), where g denotes the
general. Let majority be a (deterministic) function that maps each multiset (or bag)
of elements from {0, 1} to either 0 or 1; in a multiset, the same element can occur
multiple times. If more than half of the elements in a multiset M are equal to b, then
majority(M) = b.
The algorithm Broadcastg(N, k) proceeds in k + 1 pulses.
• Pulse 1: the general g, if correct, broadcasts its value, and decides for its value.
13.3 Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm 129
Each correct lieutenant q acts as follows. If q receives a value b from g, then it
sets its value to b; else it sets its value to 0.
– If k = 0, then q decides for its value.
– If k > 0, then for every lieutenant p, q takes part in Broadcastp(N − 1, k − 1),
starting in pulse 2.
• Pulse k + 1 (if k > 0): each correct lieutenant q has, for every lieutenant p,
computed a value in Broadcastp(N − 1, k − 1); it stores these N − 1 values
in a multiset Decisionsq. Finally, q sets its value to majority(Decisionsq), and
decides for this value.
Note that if the general is correct, then it can decide immediately, because by the
dependence requirement all correct lieutenants are supposed to decide for the general’s
value. If k = 0, then the general is certainly correct, so that the lieutenants can
also decide immediately, for the received value. However, if k > 0, then the lieutenants
must count with the fact that the general may be Byzantine. Therefore, each
correct lieutenant p starts a recursive call Broadcastp(N − 1, k − 1), reminiscent of
the echo principle in the Bracha-Toueg Byzantine consensus algorithm; the general
is excluded from this calls. This gives rise to a cascade of recursive calls, because if
k > 1, then each of these calls may start another N − 2 recursive calls, and so on.
We informally argue the correctness of the Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm;
a more formal proof will be given at the end of this section. In case the
general is correct, each recursive call Broadcastp(N − 1, k − 1) with p correct is
guaranteed to yield the general’s value at all correct lieutenants. Since a majority
of the lieutenants is correct, by definition of the majority function, all correct lieutenants
will decide for the general’s value. On the other hand, in case the general is
Byzantine, by induction on k, all correct lieutenants are guaranteed to compute the
same values in the N − 1 recursive calls Broadcastp(N − 1, k − 1). So due to the
deterministic nature of the majority function, in pulse k + 1 all correct lieutenants
will compute and decide for the same value in Broadcastg(N, k).
We consider two examples of the Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm:
one where the general is correct and one where the general is Byzantine.
Example 13.3 Consider a complete network with four processes g, p, q, r, and k =
1. Suppose that the general g and lieutenants p, q are correct, while lieutenant r
is Byzantine. We consider one possible computation of the Lamport-Shostak-Pease
broadcast algorithm Broadcastg(4, 1) on this network.
In pulse 1, g broadcasts and decides for 1. So after pulse 1, p and q carry the
value 1. These lieutenants build, by the three recursive calls Broadcasts(3, 0) with
s ∈ {p, q, r}, a multiset {1, 1, b}, where b can be distinct for p and q, as they may
compute different values in Broadcastr(3, 0). Since the majority of values in these
multisets equals 1, both p and q decide for 1.
Example 13.4 Consider a complete network with N = 7 and k = 2. Suppose that
the general g and one lieutenant r are Byzantine. We consider one possible computation
of the Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm Broadcastg(7, 2) on this
network.
130 13 Byzantine Failures
In pulse 1, the general sends 0 to three correct lieutenants, and 1 to the other two
correct lieutenants. The five correct lieutenants all build, by the six recursive calls
Broadcasts(6, 1), the same multiset M = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, b}, for some b ∈ {0, 1}.
Namely, even in Broadcastr(6, 1), all correct lieutenants are guaranteed to compute
the same value b. So they all decide for majority(M).
For instance, in Broadcastr(6, 1) the Byzantine lieutenant r could send 0 to two
correct lieutenants, and 1 to the other three correct lieutenants. Then the five correct
lieutenants all build, by five recursive calls Broadcasts(5, 0), the same multisetM =
{0, 0, 1, 1, 1}. So in this case b = major({0, 0, 1, 1, 1}) = 1.
Theorem 13.6 The Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm is a k-Byzantine
broadcast algorithm for any k < N3
.
Proof. Let f be the number of Byzantine processes in the network. First we prove
that if the general g is correct, and f < N−k
2 , then in Broadcastg(N, k) all correct
processes decide for g’s value. This holds even iff > k.
We prove this claim by induction on k. The base case k = 0 is trivial, because g
is assumed to be correct, so all correct processes decide for g’s value in pulse 1. We
now consider the inductive case k > 0. Since g is assumed to be correct, in pulse 1,
all correct lieutenants set their value to g’s value. By assumption,f < (N−1)−(k−1)
2 ,
so by induction, for all correct lieutenants q, in Broadcastq(N − 1, k − 1) the value
of q, that is, g’s value is computed. Since a majority of the lieutenants is correct
(f < N−1
2 ), in pulse k+1, a majority of the values that a correct lieutenant computes
in the recursive calls Broadcastq(N − 1, k − 1) equal g’s value. So in pulse k + 1,
each correct lieutenant computes and decides for g’s value.
Now we prove that the Lamport-Shostak-Pease broadcast algorithm is a k-
Byzantine broadcast algorithm for any k < N3
, again by induction on k. The case
where g is correct follows immediately from the statement proved above, together
with the fact that f < N3
< N−k
2 . Therefore, we can assume that g is Byzantine (so
k > 0). Then at most k − 1 lieutenants are Byzantine. Since k − 1 < N−1
3 , by induction,
all correct lieutenants compute the same value in Broadcastp(N −1, k−1)
for every lieutenant p. Hence, all correct lieutenants compute the same multisetM in
pulse k + 1. So all correct lieutenants decide for the same value majority(M). ⊓$
13.4 Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm
A public-key cryptographic system consists of a finite message domainMand, for
each process q, functions Sq, Pq : M → M with Sq(Pq(m)) = Pq(Sq(m)) =
m for all m ∈ M. The key Sq is kept secret by q, while Pq is made public. The
underlying assumption is that computing Sq from Pq is very expensive. A wellknown
and widely used public-key cryptographic system is RSA.
If a process p wants to send a secret message m to a process q, then p can send
Pq(m) to q. Because only q knows the secret key Sq that is needed to decrypt this
message. Furthermore, if p wants to send a signed message m to q, such that other
13.4 Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm 131
processes cannot fraudulently sign their messages with p’s signature, then p can send
⟨m, Sp(m)⟩ to q. Because only p can compute Sp(m), and q can obtain p’s public
key Pp, apply this to the signature Sp(m), and check whether the result equals the
message m.
The Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm for synchronous systems
uses this signature principle of public-key cryptographic systems in such a way that
the Byzantine processes cannot lie about the values they have received. It is a correct
and terminating k-Byzantine broadcast algorithm for any k. Each process p has a
secret key Sp and a public key Pp. We step away from binary Byzantine broadcast:
the correct processes must uniformly pick a value from a large domain of possible
values. The reason is that on a small domain (in case of binary consensus consisting
of only two values), computing Sq from Pq is easy. It is assumed that processes q ̸= p
cannot guess values Sp(v) without acquiring extra knowledge about Sp.
The Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm proceeds in k + 1 pulses:
• In pulse 1, the general, if correct, broadcasts ⟨valueg, (Sg(valueg), g)⟩, and decides
for valueg.
• If in a pulse i ≤ k + 1 a correct lieutenant q receives a message ⟨v, (σ1, p1) :
· · · : (σi, pi)⟩ that is valid, meaning that
– p1 = g,
– p1, . . . , pi, q are distinct, and
– Ppk (σk) = v for all k = 1, . . . , i,
then q includes v in the set Valuesq.
If i ≤ k, then in pulse i + 1, q sends to all other lieutenants the message
⟨v, (σ1, p1) : · · · : (σi, pi) : (Sq(v), q)⟩.
• After pulse k+1, each correct lieutenant q decides for v if Valuesq is a singleton
{v}, or 0 otherwise. (In the latter case, the general is Byzantine.)
The second part of a message is a list of signatures. If a correct lieutenant q
receives a valid message, meaning that the signatories are distinct, include the general
and not the receiver, and each signatory p has added the correct signature Sp(v),
where v is the value contained in the first part of the message, then q takes v on
board as possible value, adds its signature to the list of signatures, and broadcasts the
message. A key observation is that each such message in pulse k+1 contains a list of
k +1 signatures, so at least one signature from a correct process. This means that no
later than pulse k + 1, every lieutenant will have received a valid message with this
value. As a result, after pulse k + 1 all correct lieutenants have computed the same
set Values. So they all decide for the same value. And if the general is correct, then
these sets are guaranteed to only contain valueg, because then Byzantine processes
cannot forge signatures by the general for other values.
Example 13.5 Consider a complete network of four processes g, p, q, r, and let
k = 2. Suppose that the general g and lieutenant r are Byzantine. We consider one
possible computation of the Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm.
132 13 Byzantine Failures
– In pulse 1, g sends ⟨0, (Sg(0), g)⟩ to p and q, and ⟨1, (Sg(1), g)⟩ to r. Then
Valuesp and Valuesq become {0}.
– In pulse 2, p and q broadcast ⟨0, (Sg(0), g) : (Sp(0), p)⟩ and ⟨0, (Sg(0), g) :
(Sq(0), q)⟩, respectively. And r sends ⟨1, (Sg(1), g) : (Sr(1), r)⟩ to only q. Then
Valuesp remains {0}, while Valuesq becomes {0, 1}.
– In pulse 3, q broadcasts ⟨1, (Sg(1), g) : (Sr(1), r) : (Sq(1), q)⟩. Then Valuesp
becomes {0, 1}.
– After pulse 3, p and q both decide for 0, because Valuesp and Valuesq contain
two elements.
Theorem 13.7 The authentication algorithm from Lamport-Shostak-Pease is a k-
Byzantine broadcast algorithm for any k.
Proof. If the general is correct, then Byzantine processes will not get an opportunity
to forge a signature for a value different from valueg on behalf of the general. So
owing to authentication, correct lieutenants will only add valueg to their set Values.
Hence, all processes will decide for valueg.
Suppose a correct lieutenant q receives a valid message ⟨v, ℓ⟩ in a pulse i =
1, . . . , k + 1. We distinguish two cases.
• i ≤ k: then in the next pulse, q broadcasts a message that will make all correct
lieutenants add v to their set Values.
• i = k + 1: since the list ℓ of signatures has length k + 1, it contains a correct
process p. Then p received a valid message ⟨v, ℓ′⟩ in a pulse j ≤ k. In pulse
j +1, p has broadcast a message that makes all correct lieutenants add v to their
set Values.
So after pulse k + 1, Valuesq is the same for all correct lieutenants q. Hence, after
pulse k + 1 they all decide for the same value. ⊓%
The Dolev-Strong optimization minimizes the number of required messages.
This optimization lets each correct lieutenant broadcast at most two messages, with
different values. When it has broadcast two different values, all correct lieutenants
are certain to compute a set Values with at least two values, so that all correct lieutenants
will decide for 0.

Let the local clocks of p0 and p1 run half as fast as real time, and let the local clock
of p2 run twice as fast as real time. Consider the Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer
for some precision δ > 0, whereby it is assumed that dmax = 0 (that is, messages
are communicated instantaneously).
(a) What is the smallest ρ > 1 for which the clocks of p0, p1, p2 are all ρ-bounded?
(b) Suppose that at real time τ , the clocks of p0 and p1 are at τ− δ3
, while the clock at
p2 is at τ + δ3
. Let p0, p1, p2 synchronize their clocks at real time τ + δ
3ρ (with the
ρ from part (a)). Show that whatever input q gives at this synchronization point,
the clocks of p0, p1, p2 are not more than 2δ
3 apart.
(c) Repeat the exercise in part (b), but now leaving out p0. Show that in this case
after synchronization at real time τ + δ
3ρ , the clocks of p1 and p2 can be more
than 2δ
3 apart.
Exercise 13.4 Argue the impossibility of k-Byzantine clock synchronization for
general N and k ≥ N3
.
Exercise 13.5 The k-Byzantine synchronizer of Lamport and Melliar-Smith differs
from the Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer in one aspect: a correct process p accepts
a local clock value of another process q if it differs no more than δ from its own clock
value, at the moment of synchronization.
Explain why that synchronizer has precision 3k
N δ (versus precision 2k
N δ of the
Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer).
Exercise 13.6 Explain how the Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer must be adapted
in case dmax > 0.
Exercise 13.7 Let N = 5 and k = 1, and let the general g be Byzantine. Suppose
that in pulse 1, g sends the value 1 to two lieutenants, and the value 0 to the other
two lieutenants. Give a computation of Broadcastg(5, 1) (including a definition of
the majority function) such that all lieutenants decide for 0.
134 13 Byzantine Failures
Exercise 13.8 Let N = 7 and k = 2, and let the general g and one lieutenant be
Byzantine. Give a computation of Broadcastg(7, 2) (and its subcalls) in which all
correct lieutenants decide for majority({0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1}).
Exercise 13.9 [76] Determine the worst-case message complexity of the correct processes
in Broadcastg(N, k).
Exercise 13.10 Apply the Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm to a
complete network of five processes. Let three of the processes be Byzantine. Give
a computation in which the two correct processes would decide for different values
at the end of pulse 3, but decide for the same value in pulse 4.
Exercise 13.11 Let k ≥ N − 1. Explain why the Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication
algorithm can then be adapted by letting it already terminate at the end of
pulse N − 1.
Exercise 13.12 Determine the worst-case message complexity of the correct processes
in the Lamport-Shostak-Pease authentication algorithm, taking into account
the Dolev-Strong optimization.

Mutual Exclusion
Mutual exclusion in distributed systems aims to serialize access to a shared resource,
such as updating a database or sending a control signal to an I/O device. Although
multiple processes may want to access the resource concurrently, at any moment in
time at most one process should be privileged, meaning that it is allowed access. A
process that becomes privileged is said to enter its critical section, which is a block
of source code where the process needs access to the resource. When a process gives
up the privilege, it is said to exit its critical section. Mutual exclusion algorithms are
supposed to satisfy the following two properties, in each execution:
• Mutual exclusion: in every configuration, at most one process is privileged.
• Starvation-freeness: if a process p tries to enter its critical section, and no process
remains privileged forever, then p will eventually enter its critical section.
In a message-passing setting, mutual exclusion algorithms are generally based
on one of the following three paradigms.
• A logical clock: requests for entering a critical section are prioritized by means
of logical time stamps.
• Token passing: the process holding the token is privileged.
• Quorums: to become privileged, a process needs the permission from a quorum
of processes. Each pair of quorums should have a nonempty intersection.
We will discuss one mutual exclusion algorithm for each of these categories.
14.1 Ricart-Agrawala algorithm
The Ricart-Agrawala mutual exclusion algorithm uses a logical clock (see chapter
2). For simplicity, we assume that the network topology is complete.
When a process pi (where i is its ID) wants to enter its critical section, it sends
the message ⟨request, tsi, i⟩ to all other processes, with tsi its logical time stamp.
The second argument of this message, the process ID, is meant to break ties between
two competing processes that send concurrent requests with the same logical time
136 14 Mutual Exclusion
stamp; then the request from the process with the lowest ID has the highest priority.
When another process pj receives this request, it sends permission to pi as soon as:
• pj is not privileged, and
• pj does not have a pending request with a logical time stamp tsj where (tsj, j) <
(tsi, i) (with respect to the lexicographical order).
pi enters its critical section when it has received permission from all other processes.
Actually, the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm does not require a full-blown logical
clock. It suffices if only requests are taken into account. That is, if a process receives
a request with time stamp t, then it increases its clock value to t + 1.
We consider two examples, both with N = 2. Let clocks start at time 1.
Example 14.1 p1 sends ⟨request, 1, 1⟩ to p0. At reception of this request, p0 sends
permission to p1, and sets its clock value to 2. Next, p0 sends ⟨request, 2, 0⟩ to p1.
When p1 receives this message, it does not send permission to p0, because (1, 1) <
(2, 0); it sets its clock value to 3. Finally, p1 receives permission from p0, and enters
its critical section.
Example 14.2 p1 sends ⟨request, 1, 1⟩ to p0, and p0 sends ⟨request, 1, 0⟩ to p1.
When p0 receives the request from p1, it does not send permission to p1, because
(1, 0) < (1, 1). When p1 receives the request from p0, it does send permission to p0,
because (1, 0) < (1, 1). Both p0 and p1 set their clock value to 2. Finally, p0 receives
permission from p1, and enters its critical section.
We argue that the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm guarantees mutual exclusion. Suppose
a process p wants to enter its critical section and sends requests to all other
processes. When another process q sends permission to p, q is not privileged; and
since q’s pending or future request is larger than p’s request, q will not get permission
from p to enter its critical section until after p has entered and left its critical
section. The Ricart-Agrawala algorithm is also starvation-free, because each request
will eventually become the smallest request in the network.
A drawback of the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm is the high message overhead, because
requests must be sent to all other processes. The Carvalho-Roucairol optimization
reduces this message overhead. Suppose a process p entered its critical section
before and wants to enter it again. Then p only needs to send requests to processes
that p has sent permission to since the last exit from its critical section. Because as
long as another process q has not obtained p’s permission, q cannot enter its critical
section (even when the Carvalho-Roucairol optimization is being applied), because
q has previously given permission to p. If such a process q sends a request to p while
p is waiting for permissions, and q’s request is smaller than p’s outstanding request,
then p sends both permission and a request to q.
14.2 Raymond’s algorithm 137
14.2 Raymond’s algorithm
Raymond’s mutual exclusion algorithm is based on token passing; only the process
holding the token may be privileged. It assumes an undirected network, and starts
from a spanning tree in this network; the root of this sink tree holds the token.
Each process maintains a FIFO queue, which can contain IDs of its children in
the sink tree, and its own ID. Initially, this queue is empty. A process maintains its
queue as follows:
• When a nonroot wants to enter its critical section, it adds its ID to its own queue.
• Each time a nonroot gets a new head at its (nonempty) queue, it sends a request
for the token to its parent in the sink tree.
• When a process receives a request for the token from a child, it adds the ID of
this child at the end of its queue.
• When the root has left its critical section and its queue is or becomes nonempty,
it sends the token to the process q at the head of its queue, makes q its parent, and
removes q’s ID from the head of its queue.
In the special case that the root wants to enter its critical section again and its queue
is empty, it can become privileged straightaway.
Let a nonroot p get the token from its parent, and let the ID of the process q be at
the head of p’s queue.
• If p ̸= q, then p sends the token to q, and makes q its parent.
• If p = q, then p becomes the root; that is, it has no parent and is privileged.
In both cases, p removes q’s ID from the head of its queue.
Example 14.3 We consider one possible computation of Raymond’s algorithm, on
an undirected network of five processes. In every picture, the gray process is the root.

Initially, in the picture at the left, p3 is the root, and in its critical section. Next, in the
picture at the right, the following has happened. Since p8 wants to enter its critical
section, it placed its own ID in its queue. Since this was a new head of its queue, p8
sent a request for the token to its parent p1. As a result, p1 also placed the ID 8 in its
queue. Since this was a new head of its queue, p1 sent a request for the token to its
parent p3. As a result, p3 placed the ID 1 in its queue.

In the picture at the left, p5 wants to enter its critical section, so it placed its own ID
in its queue. Since this was a new head of its queue, p5 sent a request for the token
to its parent p3. As a result, p3 also placed the ID 5 in its queue. In the picture at the
right, p2 wants to enter its critical section, so it placed its own ID in its queue. Since
this was a new head of its queue, p2 sent a request for the token to its parent p1. As
a result, p1 also placed the ID 2 in its queue.

In the picture at the left, p3 exited its critical section. Since the ID 1 was the head of
its queue, it sent the token to p1, made p1 its parent, and removed 1 from its queue.
Then 5 became the new head of its queue, so p3 sent a request for the token to its
parent p1. When p1 received the token, it became the root. Moreover, the request
from p3 made p1 add the ID 3 to its queue. In the picture at the right, since the ID
8 was the head of its queue, p1 forwarded the token to p8, made p8 its parent, and
removed 8 from its queue. Then 2 became the new head of its queue, so p1 sent a
request for the token to its parent p8. When p8 received the token, it became the root,
removed 8 from its queue, and entered its critical section. Moreover, the request from
p1 made p8 add the ID 1 to its queue.

In the picture at the left, p8 exited its critical section. Since the ID 1 was the head of

When p1 received the token, it became the root. In the picture at the right, since the
ID 2 was the head of its queue, p1 forwarded the token to p2, made p2 its parent,
and removed 2 from its queue. Then 3 became the new head of its queue, so p1 sent
a request for the token to its parent p2. When p2 received the token, it became the
root, removed 2 from its queue, and entered its critical section. Moreover, the request
from p1 made p2 add the ID 1 to its queue.

In the picture at the left, p2 exited its critical section. Since the ID 1 was the head of
its queue, it sent the token to p1, made p1 its parent, and removed 1 from its queue.
When p1 received the token, it became the root. In the picture at the right, since the
ID 3 was the head of its queue, p1 forwarded the token to p3, made p3 its parent, and
removed 3 from its queue. When p3 received the token, it became the root.
p3
p5 p1
p2 p8
In the final picture, since the ID 5 was the head of its queue, p3 sent the token to p5,
made p5 its parent, and removed 5 from its queue. When p5 received the token, it
became the root, removed 5 from its queue, and entered its critical section.
Whenever a process holds the token, it is easy to see that it is the root of the sink
tree. Raymond’s algorithm clearly provides mutual exclusion, because at all times
at most one process holds the token. Raymond’s algorithm also provides starvationfreeness,
because eventually each request in a queue moves to the head of this queue,
and a chain of requests never contains a cycle.
140 14 Mutual Exclusion
14.3 Agrawal-El Abbadi algorithm
In the Agrawal-El Abbadi mutual exclusion algorithm, a process must obtain permission
from a quorum of processes to enter its critical section. The crucial property of
quorums is that each pair of quorums has a nonempty intersection. This guarantees
mutual exclusion. The key of the Agrawal-El Abbadi algorithm is how quorums are
defined. A strong point of this algorithm is that it can cope with processes that are
not responsive.
For simplicity, we assume that the network topology is complete and that N =
2k+1 −1 for somek > 0. The processes are structured in a binary tree of depth k. A
quorum consists of all processes on a path in this binary tree from the root to a leaf.
If a nonleaf r is unresponsive, then instead of asking permission from p, permission
can be asked from all processes on two paths: from each child of r to some leaf. We
note that a process may have to ask permission from itself.
To be more precise, a process p that wants to enter its critical section, places the
root of the tree in a queue. Then it repeatedly tries to get permission from the process
r at the head of its queue. If successful, r is removed from p’s queue; in case
r is a nonleaf, one of the two children of r is appended at the end of p’s queue. If a
nonleaf r is found to be unresponsive, then r is removed from p’s queue, and both
of its children are appended at the end of the queue, in a fixed order, to avoid deadlocks;
for instance, the left child is always placed before the right node. Otherwise,
two processes p and q could find that a nonleaf r is unresponsive, after which p and
q might obtain permission from the left and right child of r, respectively, leading to
a deadlock. If a leaf r is found to be unresponsive, p’s attempt to become privileged
must be aborted. When p’s queue becomes empty, it has received permission from
a quorum of processes, so that it can enter its critical section. After exiting its critical
section, p informs all processes in the quorum that their permission to p can be
withdrawn.
If processes may crash, a complete and strongly accurate failure detector is required,
and a process withdraws its permission if it detects that the process to which
it has given permission has crashed.
Example 14.4 Let N = 7, and suppose the processes are structured in a binary tree
as follows.
p9
p3 p4
p8 p1 p0 p5
Some possible quorums are:
14.3 Agrawal-El Abbadi algorithm 141
• {p9, p3, p8}, {p9, p3, p1}, {p9, p4, p0}, and {p9, p4, p5}.
• If p9 is not responding: {p3, p8, p4, p0}, {p3, p1, p4, p0}, {p3, p8, p4, p5}, and
{p3, p1, p4, p5}.
• If p3 is not responding: {p9, p8, p1}.
• If p4 is not responding: {p9, p0, p5}.
For more possible quorums in this network, see exercise 14.8.
Suppose that two processes p and q concurrently want to enter their critical section;
we consider one possible computation, with regard to the binary tree above.
First, p obtains permission from p9, and now it wants to obtain permission from p4.
Next, p9 crashes, which is observed by q, who now wants to obtain permission from
p3 and p4. Let q obtain permission from p3, after which it appends p8 at the end of
its queue. Next, q obtains permission from p4, after which it appends p5 at the end
of its queue. Next, p4 crashes, which is observed by p, who now wants to obtain
permission from p0 and p5. Next, q obtains permission from p8, and now it wants to
obtain permission from p5. Finally, p obtains permission from both p0 and p5, and
enters its critical section. It has obtained permission from the quorum {p9, p0, p5}.
We argue, by induction on the depth of the binary tree, that each pair of quorums
Q and Q′ have a nonempty intersection. This implies that the Agrawal-El Abbadi
algorithm guarantees mutual exclusion. A quorum that includes the root contains
a quorum in one of the subtrees below the root, while a quorum without the root
contains a quorum in both subtrees below the root. If Q and Q′ both contain the root,
then we are done, because the root is in their intersection. If they both do not contain
the root, then by induction they have elements in common in the two subtrees below
the root. Finally, if Q contains the root while Q′ does not, then Q contains a quorum
in one of the subtrees below the root, and Q′ also contains a quorum in this subtree;
so by induction, Q and Q′ have an element in common in this subtree.
The Agrawal-El Abbadi algorithm is deadlock-free, if all leaves are responsive.
This property depends crucially on the strict queue management. Suppose that in case
of an unresponsive process, its left child is placed before its right child in the queue
of a process that wants to become privileged. Consider the following total order <
on processes, based on their position in the binary tree: p < q if either p occurs at
smaller depth than q in the binary tree, or p and q occur at the same depth and q is
placed more to the right than p in the binary tree. Then a process which has obtained
permission from a process r, never needs permission from a processq < r to enter its
critical section. This guarantees that in case all leaves are responsive, some process
will always become privileged. Starvation may happen if a process infinitely often
fails to get permission from a process in the binary tree, but this could be easily
resolved.

II
Shared Memory

15
Preliminaries
In a shared-memory framework, a number of (hardware) processors communicate
with main memory, and with the other processors, over a bus. Processors and main
memory are snooping, meaning that they are listening for messages that are broadcast
over the bus.
The processes (or threads) are sequential programs that can run on a processor;
at any time at most one process is running on each processor. Processes communicate
with each other, asynchronously, via variables in main memory, called registers
(or fields). We distinguish single-reader registers, which are fields that can be read
by only one process, and multi-reader registers, which can be read by all processes.
Likewise we distinguish single-writer and multi-writer registers. Unless stated differently,
it will be assumed that registers are multi-reader.
An event at a process typically consists of a read or write to a register. Readmodify-
write operations, however, read a memory location and write a new value
into it in one atomic step; this new value may be computed on the basis of the value
returned by the read. Atomicity is obtained by keeping a lock on the bus from the
moment the value is read until the moment the new value is written. Typical examples
of read-modify-write operations are:
• test-and-set, which writes true in a Boolean register, and returns the previous
value of the register.
• get-and-increment, which increases the value of an integer register by one, and
returns the previous value of the register.
• get-and-set(new), which writes the value new in a register, and returns the previous
value of the register.
• compare-and-set(old, new), which checks whether the value of the register
equals old, and if so, overwrites it with the value new; a Boolean value is returned
to signal whether the new value was actually written.
We note that a software crash is always a consequence of a hardware instruction
(for example, a program counter is set to an incorrect address). Therefore, processes
do not crash during a read-modify-write operation; this means that, in the absence of
a hardware crash, the lock on the bus is always eventually released.
146 15 Preliminaries
Mutual exclusion is of the essence in a shared-memory framework, to avoid simultaneous
use of, for instance, a block of memory. A common way to achieve this
is by means of locks; to become privileged, one must obtain the lock, and at any
time at most one process can hold the lock. The three mutual exclusion algorithms
presented in chapter 14 basically all use this principle. In a setting with locks, we
distinguish two kinds of progress properties for mutual exclusion algorithms, under
the assumption that no process holds the lock forever. An algorithm is livelock-free if
some process trying to get the lock eventually succeeds. It is starvation-free if every
process trying to get the lock eventually succeeds.
Sometimes we will take into account caches, which are relatively small memory
units, local to a processor, to store copies of data from main memory that are frequently
used. Access to main memory is slow compared to cache access. Changes
to data values are therefore accumulated in the local cache, and written back to main
memory when needed: to make place in the cache, when another process wants the
value, or at some memory barrier which enforces that writes are performed. When
a process takes a cache miss, meaning that it cannot find some data in its cache, the
required data is fetched from main memory, or provided by a snooping processor.
We assume that some cache coherence protocol is in place to maintain the consistency
of the data in the local caches. In the presence of caches, typically synchronization
primitives are needed to avoid that processes read stale values from a cache,
but instead fetch fresh values from main memory. Notably, one can impose memory
barriers, or declare that for certain variables the writes and reads are always with
regard to main memory (for example, in Java such variables are declared volatile).
Locks and read-modify-write operations tend to come with automatic synchronization
primitives: when a process acquires a lock or performs a read-modify-write operation,
it invalidates its working memory, to ensure that fields are reread from main
memory; and when it releases the lock, modified fields in its working memory are
written back to main memory.
Exercises
Exercise 15.1 Suppose that crashes of processes cannot be observed. Argue that it is
impossible to achieve 2-crash consensus for three processes with only test-and-set.
Exercise 15.2 Give a k-crash consensus algorithm using compare-and-set that
works for any k.
16
Mutual Exclusion II
Mutual exclusion, which aims to serialize access to a shared resource (see chapter
14), is of vital importance in a shared-memory setting. Notably, a process may want
to lock a block of shared memory, to ensure exclusive access to it.
We assume that mutual exclusion needs to be resolved among N processes
p0, . . . , pN−1. The algorithms in this chapter use spinning (also called busy-waiting),
meaning that values of registers are read repeatedly, until some condition is met.
16.1 Peterson’s algorithm
Mutual exclusion for two processes
Peterson’s algorithm provides mutual exclusion for two processes p0 and p1. The
basic idea is that when a process pb wants to enter its critical section, it signals its
intention to the process p1−b by setting a Boolean flag. Next, pb repeatedly checks
whether p1−b’s flag is set. As soon as this is not the case, pb enters its critical section.
When pb exits its critical section, it resets its flag.
This simple mutual exclusion algorithm suffers from livelock, if p0 and p1 concurrently
set their flag. To avoid livelock, Peterson’s algorithm exploits a wait register.
When pb wants to enter its critical section, not only does it set its flag, but it also
sets wait to b. If pb now finds that wait = 1−b, it can enter its critical section, even
when the flag of p1−b is set. In the latter case p0 and p1 concurrently set their flag,
and p1−b wrote to wait last, so that it must wait.
To be more precise, Peterson’s algorithm uses a multi-writer register wait with
range {0, 1}, and single-writer registers flag[b] of type Boolean for b = 0, 1; only
pb can write to flag[b]. Initially, flag[b] = false. When pb wants to enter its critical
section, it first sets flag[b] to true and then wait to b. Next, it spins on flag[1−b] and
wait until flag[1 − b] = false or wait = 1 − b, and then enters its critical section.
When pb exits its critical section, it sets flag[b] to false.
Example 16.1 We consider one possible execution of Peterson’s algorithm. Initially,
flag[b] = false for b = 0, 1.
148 16 Mutual Exclusion II
– p1 wants to enter its critical section, sets flag[1] to true and wait to 1.
– p0 wants to enter its critical section and sets flag[0] to true.
– Since flag[0] = true and wait = 1, p1 does not yet enter its critical section.
– p0 sets wait to 0. Since flag[1] = true and wait = 0, p0 does not yet enter its
critical section.
– Since wait = 0, p1 enters its critical section.
– p1 exits its critical section and sets flag[1] to false.
– p1 wants to enter its critical section, sets flag[1] to true and wait to 1. Since
flag[0] = true and wait = 1, p1 does not yet enter its critical section.
– Since wait = 1, p0 enters its critical section.
We argue that Peterson’s algorithm provides mutual exclusion. Suppose pb is in
its critical section (so it performed flag[b] ← true and wait ← b), and p1−b tries to
enter its critical section. There are two possibilities:
1. Before entering its critical section, pb read flag[1 − b] = false. Then p1−b must
set flag[1 − b] to true and wait to 1 − b before it can enter its critical section.
2. Before entering its critical section, pb read wait = 1− b.
In both cases, wait has the value 1−b by the time p1−b starts spinning on flag[b] and
wait. Since, moreover, flag[b] = true, p1−b can enter its critical section only after
pb has set flag[b] to false or wait to b. Hence, p1−b must wait until pb is no longer in
its critical section.
Peterson’s algorithm is starvation-free. Let p1−b try to enter its critical section.
Then it sets flag[1 − b] to true and wait to 1 − b. Now pb could only starve p1−b by
repeatedly trying to entering its critical section, because p1−b should continuously
read flag[b] = true. However, before (re)entering, pb sets wait to b, after which
p1−b can enter its critical section.
Mutual exclusion for more than two processes
To obtain a mutual exclusion algorithm forN >2 processes, we build a tournament
tree, being a binary tree of depth k > 0 in which each node represents an application
of Peterson’s algorithm for two processes. Initially, at most two processes are
assigned to each of the 2k leaves of the tournament tree; for simplicity, we assume
that N = 2k+1. A process that wants to enter its critical section performs Peterson’s
algorithm at its leaf. When a process becomes privileged at a nonroot, it proceeds
to the parent of this node in the tournament tree. There it runs Peterson’s algorithm
again, where it may have to compete with the winner of the competition of the subtree
below the other side of this node. A process that becomes privileged at the root
in the tournament tree enters its critical section.
To be more precise, nodes in the tournament tree are numbered as follows: the
root carries number 0, and given a node with the number n, its left and right child
carry the number 2n+1 and 2n+2, respectively. To each node n we associate three
multi-writer registers: waitn with range {0, 1}, and flagn[b] of type Boolean for
b = 0, 1. Initially, flagn[b] = false. Each node has two sides, 0 and 1, and a process
pi that wants to enter its critical section is assigned to the leaf (2k − 1) + ⌊i/2⌋, at
16.1 Peterson’s algorithm 149
the side i mod 2. A process at side b of a node n performs the following procedure
Peterson(n, b).
flagn[b] ← true; waitn ← b;
while flagn[1 − b] = true and waitn = b do
{};
end while
if n = 0 then
enter critical section;
exit critical section;
else
perform procedure Peterson(⌈n/2⌉ − 1, (n + 1) mod 2);
end if
flagn[b] ← false;
The first four lines are simply Peterson’s algorithm at node n. The next six lines
express that at the root becoming privileged means entering the critical section, while
at a nonroot it means moving to the parent node, where Peterson’s algorithm is run
once again. The last line makes sure that when a process exits its critical section, its
flags at all the nodes it visited are set back to false, thus releasing processes that may
be waiting at these nodes.
Example 16.2 We consider one possible execution of Peterson’s algorithm in a tournament
tree. Let N = 8, so k = 2. Suppose that p1 and p6 both want to enter their
critical section; p1 starts at node 3, side 1, and p6 at node 6, side 0.

3 4 5 6
p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7
Initially, flagn[b] = false for all n and b.
– p6 executes Peterson(6, 0). It sets flag6[0] to true and wait6 to 0, and (since
flag6[1] = false) continues with executing Peterson(2, 1). It sets flag2[1] to
true and wait2 to 1, and (since flag2[0] = false) continues with executing
Peterson(0, 1). It sets flag0[1] to true.
– p1 executes Peterson(3, 1). It sets flag3[1] to true and wait3 to 1, and (since
flag3[0] = false) continues with executing Peterson(1, 0). It sets flag1[0] to
true and wait1 to 0, and (since flag1[1] = false) continues with executing
150 16 Mutual Exclusion II
Peterson(0, 0). It sets flag0[0] to true and wait0 to 0. Since flag0[1] = true
and wait0 = 0, p1 must wait.
– p6 finally sets wait0 to 1. Since flag0[0] = true and wait0 = 1, p6 must wait.
– Since wait0 = 1, p1 can enter its critical section.
– When p1 exits its critical section, it sets flag0[0], flag1[0], and flag3[1] to false.
– Since flag0[0] = false, p6 can enter its critical section.
We argue that the tournament tree provides mutual exclusion. Suppose that a
process p has moved from a node n, at a side b, to its critical section (if n = 0) or
to the parent of n (if n > 0). We show by induction on k − ℓ, where ℓ is the depth
of n in the tournament tree, that no other process can move away from n until p has
left its critical section. For the process at side 1−b of n this follows from the mutual
exclusion property of Peterson’s algorithm for two processes. Furthermore, if n is
not a leaf, by induction, no process can move from the child of n at side b to n until
p has left its critical section. Hence, at any time, and for any ℓ = −1, 0, . . . , k, at
most 2ℓ+1 processes can be at a node at a depth ≤ ℓ in the tournament tree, where
a critical section counts as depth −1. In particular, at any time, at most one process
can be in its critical section.
The tournament tree moreover is starvation-free. Suppose that a process p has
arrived at a node n in the tournament tree. We argue by induction on the depth of n
in the tournament tree that p will eventually enter its critical section. Suppose that
p is at the moment stuck at n. Then some other process q entered its critical section
(in the base case n = 0) or moved to the parent of n (in the inductive case n > 0),
thereby blocking p; in the casen > 0, by induction, q will eventually enter its critical
section. When q exits its critical section, it will set the flag at its side of n to false,
after which p can enter its critical section (if n = 0), or move to the parent of n (if
n > 0); in the latter case, by induction, p will eventually enter its critical section.
The tournament tree does not let processes enter their critical section in a firstcome,
first-served manner. That is, if a process p completes Peterson’s algorithm at
its leaf before another process q starts running Peterson’s algorithm at its leaf, in
general this does not guarantee that p will enter its critical section before q.
16.2 Bakery algorithm
The bakery algorithm enforces mutual exclusion similar to the way customers in a
shop are served in a first-come, first-served fashion. When entering say a bakery,
each customer gets a ticket with a number, which is increased by one with each next
ticket. The waiting customer with the smallest number is the next to be served.
Tickets could in principle be modeled by means of a multi-writer register of type
integer. However, avoiding that multiple processes concurrently read the value of
this register and increase it by one, would require the use of a read-modify-write
operation. In the bakery algorithm, a process instead reads the numbers of all other
processes, and selects as number the maximum of all those numbers plus one. To
break ties between different processes that concurrently select the same number, the
16.2 Bakery algorithm 151
ticket of a process pi that selects a number k consists of the pair (k, i), and tickets
are ordered lexicographically: (k, i) < (ℓ, j) if either k < ℓ, or k = ℓ and i < j. A
process can enter its critical section if its ticket is the smallest among all processes
that have a number greater than zero. When a process exits its critical section, it sets
its number back to zero.
To be more precise, the bakery algorithm uses single-writer registers choosingi
of type Boolean and numberi of type integer, for i = 0, . . . , N − 1; only pi can
write to choosingi and numberi. Initially, choosingi = false and numberi = 0.
A process pi that wants to enter its critical section sets choosingi to true, reads the
values of the registers numberj for all j ̸= i, writes max{numberj | 0 ≤ j <
N}+1 into numberi, and sets choosingi back to false. Next, for each j ̸= i, pi first
spins on choosingj until it is false, and then on numberj until either numberj = 0
or (numberi, i) < (numberj, j). After that pi can enter its critical section. When pi
exits its critical section, it sets numberi to 0.
Example 16.3 We consider one possible execution of the bakery algorithm. Consider
three processes p0, p1, p2; initially choosingi = false and numberi = 0 for
i = 0, 1, 2.
– p1 wants to enter its critical section, sets choosing1 to true, and reads number0
and number2.
– p0 wants to enter its critical section, sets choosing0 to true, and reads number1
and number2.
– p0 sets number0 to 1 and choosing0 to false. p0 does not yet enter its critical
section, because choosing1 = true.
– p1 sets number1 to 1 and choosing1 to false. p1 does not yet enter its critical
section, because (number0, 0) < (number1, 1) and number0 > 0.
– Since choosing1 = choosing2 = false, (number0, 0) < (number1, 1), and
number2 = 0, p0 enters its critical section.
– p0 exits its critical section and sets number0 to 0.
– p0 wants to enter its critical section, sets choosing0 to true, and reads number1
and number2.
– p0 sets number0 to 2 and choosing0 to false. p0 does not yet enter its critical
section, because (number1, 1) < (number0, 0) and number1 > 0.
– Since choosing0 = choosing2 = false, number1 < number0, and number2 =
0, p1 enters its critical section.
The bakery algorithm provides mutual exclusion. Suppose that pi is in its critical
section; then clearly numberi > 0. Moreover, let numberj > 0 for some j ̸= i. We
argue that then (numberi, i) < (numberj, j). Before pi entered its critical section,
it must have read choosingj = false, and either numberj = 0 or (numberi, i) <
(numberj, j). If pj chooses a new ticket while pi is in its critical section, then pj
is guaranteed to take numberi into account, and so will choose a larger number. To
conclude, since a privileged process always carries a positive number, and must have
the smallest ticket among all processes with a positive number, only one process can
be in its critical section at any time.
152 16 Mutual Exclusion II
The bakery algorithm is starvation-free. If a process pi wants to enter its critical
section, and other processes keep on entering and exiting their critical section, then
eventually pi will have the smallest ticket. Namely, eventually all processes that want
to enter their critical section will take the current value of numberi into account, and
will choose a number larger than numberi for their own ticket.
Let us say that a process pi enters its doorway when it sets choosingi to true,
and exits its doorway when it sets choosingi back to false. The bakery algorithm
treats processes in a first-come, first-served fashion, in the sense that if a process pi
exits its doorway before another process pj enters its doorway, then pi is guaranteed
to enter its critical section before pj .
The values of the number fields grow without bound. The bakery algorithm can
be adapted such that these values are limited to a finite range; see exercise 16.6.
16.3 N registers are required
In the bakery algorithm, a process that wants to enter its critical section reads the values
of two registers at every other process. This renders the algorithm impractical in
case of a large number of processes. The following theorem states that in principle it
is impossible to solve mutual exclusion for N processes with fewer than N registers,
with only read and write operations.
Theorem 16.1 At least N registers are needed to solve livelock-free mutual exclusion
for N processes, if only read and write operations are employed.
Proof. We sketch a proof for the case N = 2; the general case is similar. Suppose,
toward a contradiction, that a livelock-free mutual exclusion algorithm for two processes
p and q uses only one multi-writer register R.
Before p can enter its critical section, it must write to R; for else q would not be
able to recognize whether p is in its critical section. Likewise, before q can enter its
critical section, it must write to R. Due to livelock-freeness, we can bring p and q in
a position where they are both about to write to R, after which they will enter their
critical section.
Suppose without loss of generality that p writes to R first and enters its critical
section. The subsequent write by q obliterates the value p wrote to R, so that q cannot
tell that p is in its critical section. Consequently q will also enter its critical section.
This contradicts the mutual exclusion property. ⊓"
16.4 Fischer’s algorithm
Fischer’s algorithm circumvents the impossibility result from the previous section by
means of time delays.
turn is a multi-writer register, with range {−1, 0, . . . , N −1}. Initially, it has the
value −1. A process pi that wants to enter its critical section, spins on turn until its
16.5 Test-and-test-and-set lock 153
value is −1. Within one time unit of this read, pi sets the value of turn to i. Next, pi
waits for more than one time unit, and then reads turn. If it still has the value i, then
pi enters its critical section. Otherwise, pi returns to spinning on turn until its value
is −1. When a process exits its critical section, it sets the value of turn to −1.
Example 16.4 We consider one possible execution of Fischer’s algorithm. Consider
three processes p0, p1, p2, with p0 in its critical section; so turn = 0. Processes p1
and p2 both want to enter their critical section and are spinning on turn.
When p0 exits its critical section, it sets turn to −1. Now p1 and p2 concurrently
read that turn = −1. First, p1 sets the value of turn to 1, and less than one time unit
later p2 sets its value to 2. More than one time unit after it performed its write, p1
reads turn, finds that its value was changed to 2, and returns to spinning on turn. On
the other hand, more than one time unit after it performed its write, p2 reads turn,
finds that its value is still 2, and enters its critical section.
We argue that Fischer’s algorithm guarantees mutual exclusion. When turn =
−1, clearly no process is in its critical section. And when a process pi sets the value
of turn to i, other processes pj can only set the value of turn to j ̸= i within one
time unit. So if the value of turn remains i for more than one time unit, pi can be
certain that no other process can become privileged.
Fischer’s algorithm is livelock-free: when the value of turn becomes −1, processes
pi that want to enter their critical section can freely write the value i in turn.
The last process to set the value of turn within one time unit of the first write, will
enter its critical section. However, there can be starvation, in case a process pi wants
to enter its critical section, infinitely often turn is set to −1 and pi writes i in turn,
but every time this value is overwritten by a j ̸= i within one time unit.
A strong requirement of this algorithm is the presence of a global clock. Another
drawback is that processes all spin on the same register turn; why this can be
problematic will be explained in the next section.
16.5 Test-and-test-and-set lock
Test-and-set lock
The test-and-set lock circumvents the impossibility result from section 16.3 by using
a read-modify-write operation: test-and-set. This lock uses one Boolean multiwriter
register locked, which initially holds the value false. A process that wants to
acquire the lock, repeatedly applies test-and-set to locked: this operation sets the
value of locked to true and returns the previous value of locked. The process obtains
the lock (in other words, becomes privileged) as soon as false is returned by a
test-and-set operation. To unlock, the process sets locked to false.
The test-and-set lock provides mutual exclusion. When locked contains false,
clearly no process holds the lock. And when a process p acquires the lock, meaning
that it applies a test-and-set that turns the value of locked from false to true, then
154 16 Mutual Exclusion II
no other process can acquire the lock until p unlocks by setting locked to false. The
test-and-set lock moreover is livelock-free, but not starvation-free.
The test-and-set lock, although conceptually simple, tends to have a poor performance.
The reason is that each test-and-set on locked comes with a memory barrier:
at all processors it invalidates the cached value of locked. As a result, all processes
that want to acquire the lock, and so are spinning on locked, take a cache miss and
fetch the (mostly unchanged) value from main memory. This produces a continuous
storm of unnecessary messages over the bus.
Test-and-test-and-set lock
The test-and-test-and-set lock improves upon the test-and-set lock by letting processes
that want to acquire the lock spin on a cached copy of the Boolean register
locked. When false is returned, the process applies test-and-set to locked itself. The
process obtains the lock if false is returned; otherwise, it goes back to spinning on
its cached copy of locked. To unlock, the process sets locked to false.
The test-and-test-and-set lock provides mutual exclusion and livelock-freeness.
It avoids a considerable part of the bus traffic of the test-and-set lock, and therefore
tends to have a much better performance. Still, the test-and-test-and-set lock generates
unnecessary bus traffic when the lock is released. Then false is written in locked,
invalidating all cached copies. As a result, all spinners take a cache miss and go to
the bus to fetch the value of locked. Then they concurrently perform test-and-set
to try to acquire the lock, invalidating the cached copies at other processes, and thus
leading to another round of cache misses. Finally, the storm subsides and processes
return to local spinning on their cached copy of locked.
The performance of the test-and-test-and-set lock can be improved by applying
exponential back-off to reduce contention. The idea is that when a process applies
test-and-set to locked but fails to get the lock, it backs off for a certain amount
of time to avoid collisions. Each subsequent failure to get the lock by means of a
test-and-set is interpreted as a sign that there is a high contention for the lock.
Therefore, the waiting time is doubled at each failed attempt, up to some maximum.
Two important parameters, for the performance of the lock, are the initial minimum
delay and the maximum delay; optimal values for these parameters are platformdependent.
Waiting durations are randomized, to avoid that competing processes fall
into lock-step.
Example 16.5 Consider three processes p0, p1, p2 that all want to acquire the testand-
test-and-set lock. Initially, the Boolean register locked is false.
p0, p1, p2 concurrently read that (their cached copy of) locked is false. Let p1 apply
test-and-set to locked first, setting it to true. Since this operation returns false,
p1 takes the lock. Next, p0 and p2 apply test-and-set to locked. In both cases this
operation returns true, so p0 and p1 back off for (a randomization of) the minimum
delay. After this delay, p0 and p1 start spinning on their cached copy of locked.
When p1 releases the lock, it sets locked to false. Now p0 and p2 concurrently
read that the value has changed, and apply test-and-set to locked. Let p2 be the
16.6 Queue locks 155
first to do so, setting its value to true. Since this operation returns false, p2 takes
the lock. The test-and-set by p0 returns true, after which p0 backs off for twice the
minimum delay. After this delay, p0 returns to spinning on its cached copy of locked.
The test-and-test-and-set lock with exponential back-off is easy to implement,
and can give excellent performance in case of low contention. However, it may suffer
from starvation, processes may be delayed longer than necessary due to back-off, and
last but not least, all processes still spin on the same register locked, which creates a
bottleneck and generates bus traffic, especially in case of high contention.
16.6 Queue locks
Queue locks overcome the drawbacks of the test-and-test-and-set lock by placing
processes that want to acquire the lock in a queue. A process p in the queue spins
on a register to check whether its predecessor in the queue has released the lock.
When this is the case, p takes the lock. Key to the success of queue locks is that
all processes in the queue spin on a different register. Queue locks provide mutual
exclusion because only the head of the queue holds the lock. Moreover, processes
are treated in a first-come, first-served manner: the sooner a process is added to the
queue, the earlier it is served.
Anderson’s lock
Anderson’s lock places processes that want to acquire the lock in a queue by means
of a Boolean array of size n. Here n is the maximal number of processes that can
concurrently compete for the lock (so n ≤ N). A counter is used to assign a slot in
the array to every process that wants to acquire the lock; this counter is interpreted
modulo n. Always at most one process is assigned to each slot in the array, and at
most one slot in the array holds true; the process that is assigned to this slot holds
the lock. The slots in the array and the counter are multi-writer registers. Initially,
slot 0 of the array holds true, slots 1, . . . , n − 1 hold false, and the counter is zero.
A process p that wants to acquire the lock applies the read-modify-write operation
get-and-increment to the counter, which increases the counter by one and
returns the previous value of the counter. The returned value modulo n is the slot of
the process in the array. Now p spins on (a cached copy of) its slot in the array, until
it holds true, at which moment p acquires the lock. To unlock, p first sets its slot in
the array to false, and then the next slot modulo n to true, signaling to its successor
(if any) that it can take the lock.
Example 16.6 Let N = n = 3, and suppose processes p, q, r all want to acquire
Anderson’s lock. Initially, only slot 0 in the array holds true, and the counter is 0.
– q applies get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it to 1. Since this operation
returns 0, and slot 0 holds true, q takes the lock.
156 16 Mutual Exclusion II
– p applies get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it to 2. Since this operation
returns 1, and slot 1 holds false, p starts spinning on this slot.
– r applies get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it to 3. Since this operation
returns 2, and slot 2 holds false, r starts spinning on this slot.
– When q releases the lock, it sets slot 0 to false, and slot 1 to true.
– p reads that the value of slot 1 has changed to true and takes the lock.
– q wants to acquire the lock again. It applies get-and-increment to the counter,
increasing it to 4. Since this operation returns 3, and slot 3 mod 3 = 0 holds
false, q starts spinning on slot 0.
Anderson’s lock resolves the weaknesses of the test-and-test-and-set lock. In particular,
different processes spin on different registers. However, a risk is that different
slots in the array may be kept on a single cache line, being the smallest unit of memory
to be transferred between main memory and a cache. When a data item in the
cache becomes invalid, the entire cache line where the data item is kept is invalidated.
So if different slots of the array are kept on the same cache line, releasing the
lock still gives rise to unnecessary bus traffic. This may be avoided by padding: the
array size is, say, quadrupled, and slots are separated by three unused places in the
array.
A drawback of Anderson’s lock is that it requires an array of size n (or more, in
case of padding), even when no process wants the lock. Especially in case of a large
number of processes and multiple locks, this memory overhead can be costly.
CLH lock
The CLH lock does not use a fixed array. Instead, the queue of processes that are
waiting for the lock is maintained by means of a dynamic list structure; each process
that wants to acquire the lock places a node in the list. Each node ν contains a
Boolean single-writer register activeν, which becomes false after the corresponding
process has released the lock. Moreover, a multi-writer register last points to the
most recently added node in the queue. Initially, last points to a dummy node, in
which the active field is false.
A process p that wants to acquire the lock creates a node ν, with activeν = true.
It applies get-and-set(ν) to last , to make ν the last node in the queue and get a
pointer to the node of its predecessor. Next, p spins on (a cached copy of) the active
field in its predecessor’s node, until it becomes false. When this is the case, p can
take the lock. To unlock, p sets activeν to false, signaling to its successor (if any) that
it can take the lock. After releasing the lock, p can reuse the node of its predecessor
for a future lock access (but not its own node ν; see exercise 16.12).
Example 16.7 Processes p0 and p1 want to acquire the CLH lock; they create nodes
ν0 and ν1, respectively, with activeν0 = activeν1 = true. Initially, last points to a
dummy node, in which the active field is false.
– p1 applies get-and-set(ν1) to last , to let it point to ν1. Since this operation
returns the dummy node which contains false, p1 takes the lock.
16.6 Queue locks 157
– p0 applies get-and-set(ν0) to last , to let it point to ν0. Since this operation
returns ν1 which contains true, p0 starts spinning on activeν1 .
– When p1 releases the lock, it sets activeν1 to false.
– p0 reads that the value of activeν1 has changed to false and takes the lock.
The CLH lock exhibits the same good performance as Anderson’s lock, and uses
space more sparingly. The Achilles heel of the CLH lock is that due to remote spinning,
on the active field in the predecessor’s node, its performance is heavily dependent
on the presence of caches.
MCS lock
The MCS lock avoids remote spinning; instead, a process q waiting in the queue
spins on a Boolean wait field in its own node. To achieve this, q must inform its
predecessor p in the queue that q is its successor, so that after p releases the lock,
it will invert the wait field in q’s node. The price to pay is a more involved and
expensive unlock procedure, to deal with the case where q joins the queue before p
releases the lock, but informs p that q is its successor while p is releasing the lock.
Again, each process that wants to acquire the lock places a node ν in the list,
containing two multi-writer registers: a Boolean waitν, which is true as long as
the process must wait in the queue, and a pointer succν to the successor node in
the queue, or a null pointer in case ν is the last node in the queue. Moreover, the
multi-writer register last points to the last node in the queue. Initially, last = null.
A process p that wants to acquire the lock creates a node ν, with waitν = false
and succν = null. It applies get-and-set(ν) to last , to make ν the last node in the
queue and get a pointer to the node of its predecessor in the queue. If last contained
null, then p takes the lock immediately. Otherwise, p first sets waitν to true, and
then lets the succ field in the node of its predecessor point to ν. Next, p spins on
waitν until it becomes false. When this is the case, p can take the lock.
When process p releases the lock, it checks whether succν points to another
node. If so, p sets the wait field in the latter node to false, signaling to its successor
that it can take the lock. If on the other hand succν = null, then p applies
compare-and-set(ν, null) to last , signaling that the queue has become empty. If
this operation fails, meaning that it returns false, then another process q which joined
the queue in the meantime has written to last . In that case, p starts spinning on succν
until a node is returned, which is the node of q. Finally, p sets the wait field in q’s
node to false. After releasing the lock, p can reuse ν for a future lock access
Example 16.8 Processes p0 and p1 want to acquire the MCS lock; they create nodes
ν0 and ν1, respectively, containing false and null. Initially, last = null.
– p1 applies get-and-set(ν1) to last , to let it point to ν1. Since this operation
returns null, p1 takes the lock.
– p0 applies get-and-set(ν0) to last , to let it point to ν0. Since this operation
returns ν1, p0 sets waitν0 to true, lets succν1 point to ν0, and starts spinning on
waitν0 .
158 16 Mutual Exclusion II
– When p1 releases the lock, it finds that succν1 points to ν0. Therefore, p1 sets
waitν0 to false.
– p0 reads that the value of waitν0 has changed to false and takes the lock.
Example 16.9 Processes p0 and p1 want to acquire the MCS lock; they create nodes
ν0 and ν1, respectively, containing false and null. Initially, last = null.
– p1 applies get-and-set(ν1) to last , to let it point to ν1. Since this operation
returns null, p1 takes the lock.
– p0 applies get-and-set(ν0) to last , to let it point to ν0. This operation returns ν1.
– When p1 releases the lock, it finds that succν1 = null. Therefore, it applies
compare-and-set(ν1, null) to last . Since last points to ν0, this operation returns
false. Therefore, p1 starts spinning on succν1 .
– p0 sets waitν0 to true, lets succν1 point to ν0, and starts spinning on waitν0 .
– p1 finds that succν1 points to ν0 and sets waitν0 to false.
– p0 reads that the value of waitν0 has changed to false and takes the lock.
The MCS lock tends to outperform the CLH lock on so-called cacheless NUMA
(Non-Uniform Memory Access) architectures, where each processor is provided
with its own memory unit, instead of one shared-memory unit.
Timeouts
With queue locks, a process p in the queue cannot easily give up its attempt to acquire
the lock, because its successor in the queue depends on p. We now explain how the
CLH lock can be adapted to include such timeouts. The key is that p needs to tell its
successor to start spinning on the node of p’s predecessor in the queue.
Again, a process p that wants to acquire the lock places a node ν in the list, with
a single-writer register predν that contains either:
• null, in case p is waiting in the queue or is in its critical section; or
• a pointer to the node of p’s predecessor in the queue, in case p has given up
waiting for the lock; or
• a pointer to a special node called released, in case p has left its critical section.
The multi-writer register last points to the last node in the queue. Initially, last =
null.
When p wants to acquire the lock, it creates a node ν with predν = null. It applies
get-and-set(ν) to last , to make ν the last node in the queue and get a pointer
to the node of its predecessor. If last contained null, then p takes the lock immediately.
Otherwise, it spins on (a cached copy of) the pred field in its predecessor’s
node until it is not null. If it points to the node released, then p takes the lock.
Otherwise, it points to the node ν′ of the new predecessor of p (meaning that p’s
original predecessor has timed out). In that case, p continues to spin on predν′ until
it is not null.
If p quits its attempt to acquire the lock, it applies compare-and-set(ν, predp)
to last . If this operation fails, then p has a successor in the queue; in that case, p sets
Exercises 159
predν to the node of its predecessor, signaling to the successor of p that it has a new
predecessor.
When p releases the lock, it applies compare-and-set(ν, null) to last . If this
operation succeeds, then the queue has become empty. If it fails, then p has a successor
in the queue. In the latter case p sets predν to the node released, signaling to
its successor that it can take the lock.
Example 16.10 Processes p0, p1, and p2 want to acquire the CLH lock with timeouts;
they create nodes ν0, ν1, and ν2, respectively, containing null. Initially,
last = null.
– p1 applies get-and-set(ν1) to last , to let it point to ν1. Since this operation
returns null, p1 takes the lock.
– p0 applies get-and-set(ν0) to last , to let it point to ν0. Since this operation
returns ν1, p0 starts spinning on predν1 .
– p2 applies get-and-set(ν2) to last , to let it point to ν2. Since this operation
returns ν0, p2 starts spinning on predν0 .
– p0 decides to abort its attempt to acquire the lock. It lets predν0 point to ν1.
– p2 finds that predν0 has changed from null to ν1 and starts spinning on predν1 .
– When p1 releases the lock, it applies compare-and-set(ν1, null) to last . This
operation fails, because last points to ν2 instead of ν1. Therefore, p1 lets predν1
point to released.
– p2 finds that predν1 has changed from null to released and takes the lock.
Bibliographical notes
Peterson’s mutual exclusion algorithm for two processes originates from [62], and
the bakery algorithm from [44]. The fact that mutual exclusion for N processes requires
N registers was proved in [13]. Fischer’s algorithm was proposed in an email
by Michael J. Fischer in 1985, and put forward in [46]. The test-and-test-and-set lock
is due to [42]. Anderson’s lock stems from [3], the CLH lock from [23, 51], the MCS
lock from [58], and the CLH lock with timeouts from [69].
Exercises
Exercise 16.1 Explain why the following mutual exclusion algorithm is flawed. Let
flag be a multi-writer Boolean register. A process p wanting to enter its critical section
waits until flag = false. Then p performs flag ← true and becomes privileged.
When p exits its critical section, it performs flag ← false.
Exercise 16.2 2-mutual exclusion is satisfied if at any time at most two processes
are in their critical section. Modify the tournament tree (in which the nodes run
Peterson’s algorithm) to yield a solution for the 2-mutual exclusion problem.

Exercise 16.3 Present a starvation-free 2-mutual exclusion algorithm, using one register
and a read-modify-write operation.
Exercise 16.4 Suppose that in the bakery algorithm a process could enter its critical
section without waiting for all choosing registers to become false. Give an example
to show that then mutual exclusion is no longer guaranteed.
Exercise 16.5 Describe an execution of the bakery algorithm in which the values of
number registers grow without bound.
Exercise 16.6 Adapt the bakery algorithm such that the range of the number registers

Exercise 16.7 Argue the correctness of theorem 16.1 for the case N = 3.
Exercise 16.8 Explain why the proof of theorem 16.1 does not apply to Fischer’s
algorithm.
Exercise 16.9 Give an example of starvation with Fischer’s algorithm.
Exercise 16.10 Argue in detail that Anderson’s lock provides mutual exclusion and
first-come, first-served fairness.
Exercise 16.11 Give an example (with n = 3) to show what could go wrong if in
Anderson’s lock a process that releases the lock would first set the next slot modulo
n in the array to true, and only then its own slot to false.
Exercise 16.12 [37] Suppose that in the CLH lock, a process would reuse its own
node (instead of the node of its predecessor). Give an execution to show that then the
algorithm would be flawed.
Exercise 16.13 For each of the two read-modify-write operations in the MCS lock,
replace this operation by read and write operations, and give an execution to show
that the resulting lock is flawed. In both cases explain which property is violated.
Exercise 16.14 Argue in detail that (the unlock procedure of) the MCS lock does
not suffer from deadlock.
Exercise 16.15 Consider for the MCS lock the situation where a process p wants to
acquire the lock and finds that last points to a node. Suppose that p would first set
the succ field of that node to its own node, and only then set the wait field in its own
node to true. What could go wrong?
Exercise 16.16 Develop a variant of the MCS lock that includes timeouts, allowing
a process to abandon its attempt to obtain the lock.

Barriers
Suppose processes must collectively wait at some point until all processes have arrived
there, after which they can leave the barrier and resume execution. For example,
this can be necessary for a soft real-time application, where a number of subtasks
may have to be completed by the different processes before the overall application
can proceed. This can be achieved by means of a barrier, which keeps track whether
all processes have reached it. When the last process has reached the barrier, all processes
can leave the barrier and resume execution.
Waiting at a barrier resembles waiting to enter a critical section. It can be based
on spinning on local or (locally cached copies of) remote variables, or on falling
asleep when the barrier is reached and being woken up when all processes have
reached the barrier.
17.1 Sense-reversing barrier
A straightforward way to implement a barrier is to maintain a counter, being a multiwriter
register, with initial value 0. Each process that reaches the barrier performs
get-and-increment on the counter; a read-modify-write operation is needed, because
otherwise multiple processes could concurrently increase the counter to the
same value. When the counter equals the number N of processes that must reach the
barrier, all processes can leave the barrier.
If a process reaches the barrier and applies a get-and-increment that returns a
value smaller than N −1, then it can fall asleep. The last process to reach the barrier,
for which get-and-increment returns N − 1, first resets the value of the counter to
0, so that it can be reused, and then wakes up all other processes. A drawback of this
approach is that the waking-up phase can be time-consuming.
A better idea may be to use a global Boolean sense field, a multi-writer register,
which initially is false. Moreover, each process carries a local Boolean sense field, a
single-reader/single-writer register, which initially is true. A process p that reaches
the barrier applies get-and-increment to the counter. In case p is not the last to reach
the barrier, meaning that get-and-increment returns a value smaller than N − 1, it
162 17 Barriers
starts spinning on the barrier’s global sense field until it equals p’s local sense, after
which p can leave the barrier. On the other hand, in case p is the last to reach the
barrier, it first resets the counter to 0, so that it can be reused, and then reverses the
value of the global sense field, signaling to the other processes that they can leave
the barrier. Processes resume execution with reversed local sense, so that not only the
counter but also the (global and local) sense fields can be reused for a next barrier.
Example 17.1 We consider one possible execution of the sense-reversing barrier.
Given three processes p, q, r, initially with local sense true. The barrier’s counter
initially has the value 0, and its global sense is false.
– Process q reaches the barrier and applies get-and-increment to the counter,
which returns 0. Therefore, q starts spinning on the global sense field until it
is true.
– Process p reaches the barrier and applies get-and-increment to the counter,
which returns 1. Therefore, p starts spinning on the global sense field until it
is true.
– Process r reaches the barrier and applies get-and-increment to the counter,
which returns 2. Therefore, r resets the value of the counter to 0, reverses the
global sense field to true, and leaves the barrier with reversed local sense false.
– Processes p and q notice that the global sense of the barrier has become true, and
also leave the barrier with reversed local sense false.
The main drawback of the sense-reversing barrier is, similar to the test-and-testand-
set lock, that processes that have arrived at the barrier are all spinning on (a
cached copy of) the same global sense field.
17.2 Combining tree barrier
The combining tree barrier uses a tree structure to reduce contention on the global
sense field. Each node represents a sense-reversing barrier; processes that are waiting
at the barrier, are spinning on the global sense field of a node.
Let the tree have depth k, and let each node at a depth smaller than k have r
children. The corresponding combining tree barrier can cope with rk+1 processes: to
each leaf we assign at most r processes. For simplicity, we assume that N = rk+1.
Each node maintains a counter and a global sense field. At a leaf, the counter keeps
track how many of its processes have reached the barrier, while at a nonleaf it keeps
track at how many of the children of the node the counter has become r. As soon as
the counter of a nonroot becomes r, the counter of the parent of this node is increased
by one. When finally the counter at the root of the tree becomes r, we can be certain
that all processes have reached the barrier. Then the counters are reset, and the global
sense fields are reversed at all the nodes, from top (the root) to bottom (the leaves),
after which all processes resume execution.
To be more precise, nodes in the tree are numbered as follows: the root carries
number 0, and given a node with the number n, its children carry the numbers rn +
17.2 Combining tree barrier 163
1 up to rn + r. To each node n we associate two multi-writer registers: countn
of type integer and gsensen of type Boolean. We assume that there are processes
p0, . . . , pN−1. Each process pi maintains a single-reader/single-writer local sense
field lsensei. Initially, countn = 0, gsensen = false, and lsensei = true. Process
pi is assigned to leaf rk−1 + rk−2 + · · · + 1 + ⌊i/r⌋ in the tree. That is, when
pi reaches the barrier, it performs the following procedure CombiningTree(n) with
n = rk−1 + rk−2 + · · ·+1+⌊i/r⌋.
if countern.get-and-increment < r − 1 then
while gsensen ̸= lsensei do
{};
end while
else
if n > 0 then
perform procedure CombiningTree(⌈nr
⌉ − 1);
end if
countn ← 0; gsensen ← lsensei;
end if
A process pi performing CombiningTree(n) first applies get-and-increment to the
counter at node n. If the counter is increased to a value smaller than r, then pi starts
spinning on the global sense field of n until it equals pi’s local sense. On the other
hand, if pi increases the counter at n to r, then we distinguish the case where n is a
nonroot from the case where n is the root of the tree. If n is a nonroot, then pi moves
to the parent of n in the tree, where it performs CombiningTree again. If n is the
root of the tree, then all processes have reached the barrier. In this case pi resets the
counter at the root to 0, so that it can be reused, and next reverses the value of the
global sense field at the root, signaling to the r − 1 processes spinning on this field
that they can leave the barrier.
Processes that find the global sense field they are spinning on reversed, and the
process that reverses the global sense at the root, reset the counter and reverse the
global sense field at all the nodes they visited before, signaling to the r−1 processes
spinning on such a field that they can leave the barrier. Processes resume execution
with reversed local sense, so that the counters and sense fields can be reused for a
next barrier.
Example 17.2 We consider one possible execution of the combining tree barrier. Let
k = 2, r = 2, and N = 8. The processes p0 up to p7 are assigned to the leaves of
the tree as depicted below. Initially, the counters at the nodes are 0, the global sense
fields at the nodes are false, and all processes have local sense true.

– Let p0, p2, p4, and p7 arrive at the barrier. They apply get-and-increment to the
counter of their leaf, increasing it to 1. Next, they start spinning on the global
sense field of their leaf, until it becomes true.
– Let p1 and p6 arrive at the barrier. They apply get-and-increment to the counter
of leaf 3 and 6, respectively, increasing it to 2. Next, they move to node 1 and 2
respectively, where they apply get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it
to 1. They start spinning on the global sense field of node 1 and 2 respectively,
until it becomes true.
– Let p3 arrive at the barrier. It applies get-and-increment to the counter of leaf 4,
increasing it to 2. Next, it moves to node 1, where it applies get-and-increment
to the counter, increasing it to 2. Next, it moves to the root, where it applies
get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it to 1. It starts spinning on the
global sense field of the root, until it becomes true.
The resulting situation is as follows.

– Finally, p5 arrives at the barrier. It applies get-and-increment to the counter
of leaf 5, increasing it to 2. Next, it proceeds to node 2, where it applies
get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it to 2. Next, it moves to the root,
where it applies get-and-increment to the counter, increasing it to 2. It reverses
the global sense field of the root to true.
– p5 moves to node 2, where it reverses the global sense field to true. And p3,
which finds that the global sense field of the root has become true, moves to
node 1, where it reverses the global sense field to true.
– p5 and p3 move to leaf 5 and 4, respectively, where they reverse the global sense
field to true. And p1 and p6, which find that the global sense field of node 1 and
17.3 Tournament barrier 165
2, respectively, has become true, move to leaf 3 and 6, respectively, where they
reverse the global sense field to true.
– p0, p2, p4, and p7 find that the global sense field they are spinning on has become
true. All eight processes leave the barrier and continue their execution with reversed
local sense false.
We argue that the combining tree barrier is correct. It is easy to see, by induction
on depth, that the counter at a node n becomes r if and only if the processes assigned
to the leaves below n have all reached the barrier: in the base case of the induction, n
is a leaf, and in the inductive case, the claim has already been proved for the children
of n. So in particular, the counter at the root becomes r if and only if all processes
have reached the barrier. Furthermore, when this happens, it is guaranteed that the
global sense fields at all nodes are reversed, so that all processes leave the barrier.
17.3 Tournament barrier
The tournament barrier is an improvement over the combining tree barrier in the
sense that it allows processes to spin on local variables, and does not use any readmodify-
write operations.
Consider a tournament tree of a depth k > 0, being a binary tree in which each
node represents a barrier of size two. The corresponding tournament barrier can cope
with 2k+1 processes: to each leaf we assign at most two processes. For simplicity,
we assume that N = 2k+1. Each node is divided into an active and a passive side;
both sides of the node carry a global sense field. The active and passive side of every
nonleaf in the tree have one child each, and to both the active and the passive side of
every leaf in the tree one process is assigned.
The idea behind the tournament barrier is that a process p at the passive side of
a node signals to (the global sense field of) its active partner at this node that p has
arrived at the barrier. Next, p starts spinning on the global sense field of its passive
side until it has been reversed, after which p can leave the barrier. Conversely, a
process at the active side of a node waits until it receives a signal that its passive
partner at this node has arrived at the barrier, and then either moves on to the parent
of this node, at a nonroot, or concludes that the barrier has been completed, at the
root. In the latter case the passive global sense fields are reversed at all the nodes,
from top (the root) to bottom (the leaves), after which all processes resume execution,
with reversed local sense.
To be more precise, nodes in the tree are numbered similar to the combining tree
barrier with r = 2 (and the binary tree in Peterson’s algorithm). To each node n we
associate two Boolean multi-writer registers: asensen and psensen. We assume that
there are processes p0, . . . , pN−1. Each process pi maintains a single-reader/singlewriter
local sense field lsensei. Initially, asensen = psensen = false and lsensei =
true. Process pi is assigned to leaf (2k − 1) + ⌊i/2⌋ in the tree, at the active side
if i is even and at the passive side if i is odd. That is, when pi reaches the barrier, it
performs the following procedure Tournament(n, b) with n = (2k−1)+⌊i/2⌋ and
b = i mod 2; here, b = 0 represents the active and b = 1 the passive side of node n.
166 17 Barriers
if b = 1 then
asensen ← lsensei;
while psensen ̸= lsensei do
{};
end while
else
while asensen ̸= lsensei do
{};
end while
if n > 0 then
perform procedure Tournament(⌈n2
⌉ − 1, (n + 1) mod 2);
end if
psensen ← lsensei;
end if
A process pi that performs Tournament(n, b) acts as follows.
• If b = 1, then pi sets the active sense field of n to pi’s local sense, and starts
spinning on the passive sense field of n until it equals pi’s local sense. When
this is the case, pi reverses the passive sense fields of nodes it visited before and
leaves the barrier.
• If b = 0, then pi starts spinning on the active sense field of n until it equals pi’s
local sense. In case n is not the root of the tree, pi moves to the parent of n,
where it performs Tournament again. On the other hand, in case n is the root of
the tree, pi reverses the passive sense fields of nodes it has visited and leaves the
barrier.
As we said before, processes resume execution with reversed local sense.
It is determined beforehand on which global sense fields a process will spin while
waiting for the barrier to complete. And for each global sense field of each active
or passive part of a node there is exactly one process that will spin on this field.
Therefore, each of these fields can be kept in the local memory of the process that
spins on it.
Example 17.3 We consider one possible execution of the tournament barrier. Let
k = 2 and N = 8. The processes p0 up to p7 are assigned to the leaves of the tree as
depicted below, whereby p0, p2, p4, p6 are assigned to the active and p1, p3, p5, p7 to
the passive side of their leaf. For each nonleaf, its even and odd child are assigned to
its active and passive side, respectively. Initially, the sense fields at both sides of the
nodes are false, and all processes have local sense true.

– Let p0, p2, p4, and p7 arrive at the barrier. Then p0, p2, and p4 move to their leaf,
and start spinning on the active sense field, until it equals true. And p7 moves
to its leaf 6, sets the active sense field to true, and starts spinning on the passive
sense field, until it equals true.
– Let p1 arrive at the barrier. It moves to its leaf 3, sets the active sense field to
true, and starts spinning on the passive sense field.
– When p0 finds that the active sense field of leaf 3 has become true, it moves to
node 1, where it starts spinning on the active sense field.
– Let p6 arrive at the barrier. It moves to its leaf 6, where it finds that the active
sense field is true. Therefore, it moves to node 2, sets the active sense field to
true, and starts spinning on the passive sense field.
– Let p3 arrive at the barrier. It moves to its leaf 4, sets the active sense field to
true, and starts spinning on the passive sense field.
– When p2 finds that the active sense field of leaf 4 has become true, it moves
to node 1, where it sets the active sense field to true, and starts spinning on the
passive sense field.
– When p0 finds that the active sense field of node 1 has become true, it moves to
the root, and starts spinning on the active sense field.
The resulting situation is depicted in the following diagram; p0 is spinning on the
active sense field of the root, while six other processes are spinning on a passive
sense field.

– When p4 finds that the active sense field of leaf 5 has become true, it moves to
node 2. Since the active sense field of node 2 is true, p4 moves on to the root,
where it sets the active sense field to true, and starts spinning on the passive
sense field.
– When p0 finds that the active sense field of the root has become true, it sets the
passive sense fields at nodes 0, 1, and 3 to true.
– When p4 finds that the passive sense field of the root has become true, it sets the
passive sense fields at nodes 2 and 5 to true.
– When p2 and p6 find that the passive sense field of node 1 and 2, respectively,
has become true, they set the passive sense field at leaf 4 and 6, respectively, to
true.
– p1, p3, p5, and p7 find that the passive sense field they are spinning on has become
true. All eight processes leave the barrier and continue their execution with
reversed local sense false.
Correctness of the tournament tree can be argued in a similar fashion as for the
combining tree barrier.
17.4 Dissemination barrier
The dissemination barrier progresses in rounds; in each round, every process that has
reached the barrier notifies some other process, and waits for notification by some
other process. Just as in the tournament barrier, no read-modify-write operations are
used.
Suppose that N processes p0, . . . , pN−1 are to reach the barrier. A process that
reaches the barrier starts with executing round 0. In a round n ≥ 0, each process pi
that has reached the barrier:
• notifies process p(i+2n) mod N,
• waits for notification by process p(i−2n) mod N, and
• progresses to round n + 1.
When a process completes round ⌈log2 N⌉ − 1, all N processes have reached the
barrier. So then the process can leave the barrier.
Example 17.4 We consider one execution of the dissemination barrier, with N = 5.
Since ⌈log2 5⌉ = 3, the barrier is completed after round 2.
– In round 0, each process pi notifies process p(i+1) mod 5, and waits for notification
by process p(i−1) mod 5.
– In round 1, each process pi notifies process p(i+2) mod 5, and waits for notification
by process p(i−2) mod 5.
– In round 2, each process pi notifies process p(i+4) mod 5, and waits for notification
by process p(i−4) mod 5.

round 0 round 1 round 2
When a process has completed round 2, it can leave the barrier.
Note that if, for instance, p0 has not yet reached the barrier, then p1 cannot complete
round 0, p2 and p3 cannot complete round 1, and p4 cannot complete round 2.
So no process can leave the barrier.
We argue the correctness of the dissemination barrier. When allN processes have
reached the barrier, clearly all ⌈log2 N⌉ rounds can be completed by all processes.
Now suppose that some process pi has not yet reached the barrier; we argue that then
no process can have completed round ⌈log2 N⌉−1. For simplicity, we take N = 2k
for some k > 0, so that ⌈log2 N⌉ = k. In the following explanation, subscripts of
processes are to be interpreted modulo 2k.
– Since pi has not reached the barrier, pi+1 has not completed round 0.
– Since pi, pi+1 have not completed round 0, pi+2, pi+3 have not completed round
1.
– Since pi, pi+1, pi+2, pi+3 have not completed round 1, pi+4, pi+5, pi+6, pi+7
have not completed round 2.
– · · · – Since pi, . . . , pi+2k−1−1 have not completed round k − 2, pi+2k−1, . . . , pi+2k−1
have not completed round k − 1.
Since subscripts are interpreted modulo 2k, pi+2k−1 is pi−1. So no process has left
the barrier.

Self-Stabilization
A distributed algorithm is self-stabilizing if it will always end up in a correct configuration,
even if it is initialized in an incorrect (possibly unreachable) configuration.
A strong advantage of self-stabilization is that it provides fault-tolerance in circumstances
where the system moves to an incorrect configuration, for example, due to a
hardware error or a malicious intruder. Self-stabilization can offer an attractive solution
in case failures are infrequent and temporary malfunction is acceptable, as is
often the case in operating systems and database systems. An important requirement
is that failures are resolved within a relatively short period of time.
The self-stabilizing algorithms that are discussed in this chapter target a network
of N processes. Self-stabilizing algorithms are generally presented in a sharedmemory
framework. The reason is that in a message-passing framework, all processes
might be initialized in a state in which they are waiting for a message to
arrive, in which case the network would exhibit no behavior at all. In shared memory,
processes take into account the values of variables at their neighbors, so that
such deadlocks can be avoided. We assume that the local variables at the processes
are single-writer registers and that processes can read values of variables at their
neighbors.
We will discuss self-stabilizing algorithms for mutual exclusion, where initially
multiple processes may be privileged, and for computing a spanning tree, where
initially there may, for instance, be a cycle in the spanning tree.
18.1 Dijkstra’s token ring for mutual exclusion
Dijkstra’s self-stabilizing token ring for mutual exclusion assumes a directed ring of
processes p0, . . . , pN−1. Each process pi holds a single-writer register xi with values
in {0, . . . , K −1}, where K ≥ N; process pi can read the value of the register at its
predecessor p(i−1) mod N in the ring. The privileged processes are defined as follows:
• pi for i = 1, . . . , N − 1 is privileged if xi ̸= xi−1.
• p0 is privileged if x0 = xN−1.
172 18 Self-Stabilization
Since Dijkstra’s token ring can be initialized in any configuration, clearly there can
be multiple privileged processes at the start (if N ≥ 3).
Each privileged process is allowed to change its value, causing the loss of its
privilege:
• pi can perform xi ← xi−1 if xi ̸= xi−1, for any i = 1, . . . , N − 1.
• p0 can perform x0 ← (x0 + 1) mod K if x0 = xN−1.
Example 18.1 Consider a ring of size three, with K = 3. Initially, each process has
the value 0, so that only process p0 is privileged. Then p0 can pass on the privilege
to p1, by setting x0 to 1. Next, p1 can pass on the privilege to p2, by setting x1 to 1.
Now p2 can pass on the privilege to p0, by setting x2 to 1, and so on.
In Dijkstra’s token ring, always at least one process is privileged. Namely,
if p1, . . . , pN−1 are not privileged, then it must be the case that the registers
x0, . . . , xN−1 all contain the same value. But then p0 is privileged, because x0 =
xN−1. Furthermore, an event at a process pi never increases the number of privileged
processes, because pi loses its privilege, and the event can at most cause pi’s
successor p(i+1) mod N in the ring to become privileged. So if the initial configuration
is correct, in the sense that only one process is privileged, then mutual exclusion
is guaranteed.
Example 18.2 Let N = K = 4, and consider the following initial configuration.
p0
p3
p2
2 3
0
1
p1
Initially, p1, p2, and p3 are privileged. Each computation will eventually lead to a
configuration in which only one process is privileged. The value at p0 is different
from the values at p1, p2, and p3. In the proof of theorem 18.1 it will be argued that
in each infinite computation, p0 must eventually perform an event. The only way p0
can perform an event is if the register at p3 attains the value 0. This can happen only
if first the register at p2 attains this value. And in turn this can happen only if first the
register at p1 attains the value 0. Then the registers at p1, p2, and p3 have attained the
value 0, so only p0 is privileged.
For instance, first x3 ← 1. Next, x2 ← 3 and x3 ← 3. And finally, x1 ← 0,
x2 ← 0, and x3 ← 0. Now only p0 is privileged.
18.1 Dijkstra’s token ring for mutual exclusion 173
Theorem 18.1 If K ≥ N, then Dijkstra’s token ring for mutual exclusion always
eventually reaches a correct configuration, in which starvation-free mutual exclusion
is guaranteed.
Proof. Consider an infinite computation; we need to argue that eventually a configuration
is reached in which only one process is privileged. The longest possible
sequence of transitions without an event at p0 consists of 12
(N − 1)N events at
p1, . . . , pN−1: one event at p1 (copying p0’s value), two events at p2 (copying p1’s
first and second value), and so on, up to N − 1 events at pN−1. So the infinite computation
involves infinitely many events at p0. Since at each such event p0 increases
its value by one modulo K, this implies that during the execution, x0 ranges over
all values in {0, . . . , K − 1}. Since p1, . . . , pN−1 only copy values from their predecessors,
and K ≥ N, it follows that in some configuration of the computation,
x0 ̸= xi for all i = 1, . . . , N −1. The next time p0 becomes privileged, that is, when
xN−1 = x0, clearly xi = x0 for all i = 1, . . . , N − 1. Then only p0 is privileged, so
mutual exclusion has been achieved.
Starvation-freeness follows from the fact ifN ≥ 2, then in a correct configuration
the privileged process always passes on the privilege to its successor. ⊓%
For N ≥ 3, theorem 18.1 also holds if K = N − 1. (In case N = 2 and K =
1, starvation-freeness is violated.) Let us revisit the argumentation in the proof of
theorem 18.1. When pN−1 copies the value from pN−2, the processes p1, . . . , pN−1
hold at most N − 2 different values (because N ≥ 3). Since p1, . . . , pN−1 only
copy values, they are then restricted to these N − 2 values, as long as the value
of x0 is also among these N − 2 values. Since K ≥ N − 1, and in each infinite
computation p0 performs infinitely many events, it follows that in some configuration
of the computation, x0 ̸= xi for all i = 1, . . . , N − 1. The next time p0 becomes
privileged, xi = x0 for all i = 1, . . . , N − 1. Then only p0 is privileged.
The value K = N −1 is sharp; the next example shows that if K = N −2, then
there are infinite computations in which mutual exclusion is never achieved.
Example 18.3 Let N ≥ 4 and K = N − 2, and consider the following initial
configuration.

pN−3
pN−2
N−3
N−4
N−5

0
N−3 N−3
N−6
In this configuration only p1 is not privileged.We consider one possible computation
of Dijkstra’s token ring. First, p0 sets x0 to ((N − 3) + 1) mod (N − 2) = 0. Next,
pN−1 sets xN−1 to 0, then pN−2 sets xN−2 to 1, and so on. This sequence of events
proceeds in a clockwise fashion, until finally p1 sets x1 to 0. Then we have reached
the following configuration.
pN−1
p0
p1

pN−3
pN−2

0 0
N−5
The only difference with the initial configuration is that the values of the registers
have increased by one, modulo N −2. In particular, in the configuration above again
only p1 is not privileged. This execution pattern can be repeated over and over again,
leading to an infinite computation in which always N −1 processes are privileged at
the same time.
18.2 Arora-Gouda spanning tree algorithm 175
18.2 Arora-Gouda spanning tree algorithm
In the Arora-Gouda self-stabilizing spanning tree algorithm for undirected networks,
the process with the largest ID eventually becomes the root of a spanning tree of the
network. The algorithm requires that all processes know an upper bound K on the
network size.
Each process keeps track of its parent in the spanning tree, which process is the
root, and its distance to the root via the spanning tree. Due to arbitrary initialization,
there are three complications: first, multiple processes may consider themselves the
root; second, there may be a cycle in the spanning tree; and third, there may be a
“false” root, meaning that processes may consider a process q the root while q is
not in the network at all. The idea behind the Arora-Gouda algorithm is that these
inconsistencies can be resolved if a process declares itself the root of the spanning
tree, and adapts its local variables accordingly, every time it detects an inconsistency
in the values of its local variables. Moreover, a process may resolve inconsistencies
between the values of its own local variables and those of its neighbors.
Each process p maintains the following variables.
parentp : p’s parent in the spanning tree.
rootp : the root of the spanning tree.
distp : p’s distance from the root, via the spanning tree.
The value ⊥ for parentp means that p’s parent is undefined (in particular when p
considers itself the root). A process p declares itself root, that is,
parentp ←⊥ rootp ← p distp ← 0,
when it detects an inconsistency in the values of its local variables:
– rootp < p; or
– parentp =⊥, and rootp ̸= p or distp ̸= 0; or
– parentp ̸=⊥ and parentp is not a neighbor of p; or
– distp ≥ K.
In the first case, rootp is not the largest ID in the network. In the second case, parentp
says p is the root, while rootp or distp says not. In the third case, parentp has an
improper value. And the fourth case is in contradiction with the fact that K is an
upper bound on the network size.
Suppose there is no such inconsistency in the local variables of p. Let q be a
neighbor of p with distq < K. If q = parentp and p detects an inconsistency
between its own and q’s variables, then p can bring its root and distance value in line
with those of q:
rootp ← root q distp ← distq + 1.
Furthermore, if q ̸= parentp and rootp < root q, then p can make q its parent:
parentp ← q rootp ← root q distp ← distq + 1.
176 18 Self-Stabilization
Example 18.4 We consider one possible computation of the Arora-Gouda algorithm
on the following undirected network, with K = 5. Arrows point from a child to its
parent. Note that all processes consider process 8 the root, but that this is a false root.
2 3 1
7
5
root2 = 8
dist2 = 4
root3 = 8
dist3 = 2
root1 = 8
dist1 = 3 dist5 = 4
root5 = 8
root7 = 8
dist7 = 3
First, process 3 notes that it has distance 2 to the root, while its parent 2 has distance
4. Therefore, process 3 sets its distance to 5. Then it has a distance equal to K = 5,
so it declares itself root: parent3 ←⊥, root3 ← 3, and dist3 ← 0. As a result,
processes 7 and 1 set their root to 3 and their distance to 1, and next processes 2 and
5 set their root to 3 and their distance to 2.
2 3 1
7
5
root2 = 3
dist2 = 2
root3 = 3
dist3 = 0
root1 = 3
dist1 = 1 dist5 = 2
root5 = 3
root7 = 3
dist7 = 1
Now process 5 finds an inconsistency in its local variables: its root value is smaller
than its own ID. Therefore, it declares itself root: parent5 ←⊥, root5 ← 5, and
dist5 ← 0. As a result, first process 1 makes process 5 its parent: parent1 ← 5,
root1 ← 5, and dist1 ← 1; next process 3 makes process 1 its parent: parent3 ← 1,
root3 ← 5, and dist3 ← 2; and next process 2 makes process 3 its parent:
parent2 ← 3, root2 ← 5, and dist2 ← 3.
2 3 1
7
5
root2 = 5
dist2 = 3
root3 = 5
dist3 = 2
root1 = 5
dist1 = 1 dist5 = 0
root5 = 5
root7 = 3
dist7 = 1
18.3 Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm 177
Now process 7 finds an inconsistency in its local variables: its root value is smaller
than its own ID. Therefore, it declares itself root: parent7 ←⊥, root7 ← 7, and
dist7 ← 0. As a result, processes 2 and 3 make process 7 their parent; next, process
1 makes process 3 its parent; and finally, process 5 makes process 1 its parent.
2 3 1
7
5
root2 = 7
dist2 = 1
root3 = 7
dist3 = 1
root1 = 7
dist1 = 2 dist5 = 3
root5 = 7
root7 = 7
dist7 = 0
The resulting configuration, depicted above, is stable.
We argue that the Arora-Gouda spanning tree algorithm is self-stabilizing, if only
fair computations are considered (see exercise 18.5). The key is that false root values,
which are not an ID of any process in the network, will eventually disappear.
Namely, such false roots can survive only if there is a cycle of processes that all have
this root value. Distance values of processes on such a cycle will keep on increasing,
until one of them gets distance K and declares itself root. Then the cycle is broken,
and by fairness the cycle can be reestablished only a finite number of times. Hence,
the false root of the (former) cycle will eventually be eradicated. Since false roots
are guaranteed to disappear, the process with the largest ID in the network will eventually
declare itself root. Then the network will converge to a spanning tree with this
process as the root.
To obtain a breadth-first search tree, in the Arora-Gouda algorithm, the case
where q ̸= parentp is a neighbor of p with distq < K has one extra subcase: if
rootp = root q and distp > distq + 1, then parentp ← q and distp ← distq + 1.
That is, a process can select a new parent if it offers a shorter path to the root.
18.3 Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm
The Afek-Kutten-Yung self-stabilizing spanning tree algorithm for undirected networks
does not require a known upper bound on the network size. Moreover, it
does not exhibit (unfair) infinite computations. Again, the process with the largest
ID eventually becomes the root of a spanning tree of the network.
Each process p again maintains the variables parentp, rootp, and distp. A process
p declares itself root, that is,
parentp ←⊥ rootp ← p distp ← 0,
if it does not yet consider itself root, and detects an inconsistency in the values of its
local variables, or between these values and those of its parent:
178 18 Self-Stabilization
– rootp ≤ p; or
– parentp =⊥; or
– parentp ̸=⊥, and parentp is not a neighbor of p or rootp ̸= rootparentp or
distp ̸= distparentp + 1.
Note that if there is a cycle in the spanning tree, then always a process on this
cycle will declare itself root. Namely, there is always some process p on this cycle
with distp ̸= distparentp + 1.
A process p that considers itself root can make a neighbor q its parent, if root q is
larger than p. In case several neighbors of p have a root value greater than rootp, p
selects a neighbor q with the largest root value among all p’s neighbors. Before p can
make q its parent, p must wait until q’s component of the spanning tree has a proper
root. For otherwise processes could infinitely often join a component of the spanning
tree with a false root, as shown in the next example.
Example 18.5 Consider the initial following configuration.
0 1
dist0 = 0
root0 = 2 root1 = 2
dist1 = 1
Since dist0 ̸= dist1 + 1, process 0 declares itself root: parent0 ←⊥, root0 ← 0,
and dist0 ← 0. Next, since root0 < root1, process 0 makes process 1 its parent:
parent0 ← 1, root0 ← 2, and dist0 ← 2. Next, since dist1 ̸= dist0 + 1, process 1
declares itself root: parent1 ←⊥, root1 ← 1, and dist1 ← 0. Next, since root1 <
root0, process 1 makes process 0 its parent: parent1 ← 0, root1 ← 2, and dist1 ← 3. And so on.
Therefore, before p makes q its parent, if first sends a join request to q, which is
forwarded through the spanning tree to the root, which sends back an acknowledgment
to p via the spanning tree. When p receives this acknowledgment, p makes q its
parent, that is,
parentp ← q rootp ← root q distp ← distq + 1.
Since we are in a shared-memory framework, join requests and acknowledgments
need to be encoded in shared variables; see the pseudocode in the appendix.
The path of a join request is remembered in local variables, so that the resulting acknowledgment
can follow this path in the reverse order. A process can be forwarding
and awaiting an acknowledgment for at most one join request at a time. As the encoding
of join requests in shared variables is rather involved, they are presented in
the examples in a message-passing style.
Example 18.6 We revisit the initial configuration from example 18.5, but now with
join requests and acknowledgments. We consider one possible computation of the
Afek-Kutten-Yung algorithm.
Since dist0 ̸= dist1+1, process 0 declares itself root: parent0 ←⊥, root0 ← 0,
and dist0 ← 0. Next, since root0 < root1, process 0 sends a join request to process
18.3 Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm 179
1. Note that process 1 cannot forward this join request to its parent 0, because 0
is awaiting an acknowledgment. Next, since dist1 ̸= dist0 + 1, process 1 declares
itself root: parent1 ←⊥, root1 ← 1, and dist1 ← 0. Since process 1 is now a proper
root, it replies to the join request of process 0 with an acknowledgment. As a result,
process 0 makes process 1 its parent: parent0 ← 1, root0 ← 1, and dist0 ← 1. The
resulting spanning tree, with process 1 as root, is stable.
Join requests are forwarded only between processes of which the local variables
have consistent values; else there could be infinite computations, as shown in example
18.7. And processes forward an acknowledgment only if they sent a corresponding
join request previously. This check avoids spurious acknowledgments due
to improper initial values of local variables.
Example 18.7 Given an undirected ring with three processes 0, 1, 2. Initially, processes
0 and 1 consider themselves root, while process 2 has process 0 as parent,
considers the (nonexistent) process 3 the root, and has some distance value k.
0
1
2
root2 = 3
dist0 = 0 dist2 = k
root0 = 0
dist1 = 0
root1 = 1
Since root2 > root1 (and root2 > root0), process 1 sends a join request to process 2.
Without the consistency check, process 2 would forward this join request to process
0. Since process 0 considers itself root, it would send back an acknowledgment to
process 1 (via process 2), and process 1 would make process 2 its parent and consider
process 3 the root. Next, since root2 ̸= root0, process 2 could make itself root.
0
1
2
root2 = 2
dist0 = 0 dist2 = 0
root0 = 0
dist1 = k + 1
root1 = 3
Now we would have a (nearly) symmetrical configuration to the initial one. This
scenario could be repeated to obtain an infinite computation that never reaches a
stable configuration.
We argue that the Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm is self-stabilizing.
Each component in the network with a false root contains an inconsistency, so a
process in this component will declare itself root. Since join requests are forwarded
only between consistent processes, and processes can be involved in only one join
request at a time, each join request is eventually acknowledged. Join requests guarantee
that processes only finitely often join a component with a false root, each time
180 18 Self-Stabilization
due to improper initial values of local variables. These observations together imply
that eventually false roots will disappear. Therefore, the process with the largest ID
in the network will declare itself root, and the network will converge to a spanning
tree with this process as the root.

K = N − 1 is presented in [31]. The Arora-Gouda algorithm stems from [5], and

Online Scheduling
So far we have mostly ignored timing aspects. Logical clocks were used for termination
detection and mutual exclusion, and local clocks with bounded drift were
employed to build a synchronous system in the presence of Byzantine processes. But
these were abstract representations of time. In this chapter we will consider jobs,
meaning units of work, that need to be scheduled and executed and are for this purpose
divided over the processors. These jobs have time constraints and resource requirements.
One important application of real-time computing is computer graphics in video
games, where it is vital to produce and analyze images in real time, and where there
is very little time available per image. Typically, every image is then decomposed
into triangles, and special hardware is employed to generate the pixels inside each of
the triangles separately. Another important application is air traffic control to direct
planes on the ground and through the air, based on information from different sources
such as radars, weather stations, and pilots.
19.1 Jobs
The arrival time of a job is the moment in time it arrives at a processor, while the
release time of a job is the moment in time it becomes available for execution. In
many cases these two times will coincide, but sometimes it can be useful to postpone
the release time of a job, notably for avoiding resource competition (see section
19.3). The execution time of a job at a processor is the amount of time needed to
perform the job (assuming it executes alone and all resources are available).
We disregard the functional behavior of jobs, and focus on their deadlines, meaning
the time by which they must have been completed. This can be expressed as an
absolute deadline, that is, as a fixed moment in real time, or as a relative deadline,
that is, the maximum allowed time between arrival and completion of a job. A deadline
can be hard, meaning that late completion is not allowed, or soft, meaning that
late completion is allowed but comes at some penalty.
182 19 Online Scheduling
A scheduler at a processor decides in which order jobs are performed at this
processor, and which resources they can claim. A scheduler aims to meet all hard
deadlines, meet soft deadlines as much as possible, and avoid deadlocks. Of course, a
job cannot be scheduled before its release time, and the total amount of time assigned
to a job should equal its (maximum) execution time.
In this chapter, the communication paradigm, message passing versus shared
memory, is not of the essence. In view of the fact that real-time scheduling plays
an important role in operating systems, it is placed in the shared-memory part.
A task is a set of related jobs. Three types of tasks can be distinguished:
• Periodic: such a task is known at the start of the system; the jobs have hard
deadlines.
• Aperiodic: such a task is executed in response to some external event; the jobs
have soft deadlines.
• Sporadic: such a task is executed in response to some external event; the jobs
have hard deadlines.
A periodic task is defined by three parameters:
• The release time r of the first periodic job.
• The period p, which is a periodic time interval, at the start of which a periodic
job is released.
• The execution time e of each periodic job.
For simplicity, we assume that the relative deadline of each periodic job equals its period.
The utilization of a periodic task (r, p, e) is ep, representing the relative amount
of execution time on a processor that will be consumed by this periodic task. The
utilization at a processor is the sum of utilizations of its periodic tasks. Clearly,
scheduling of the periodic tasks at a processor is possible only if its utilization does
not exceed one.
Example 19.1 Consider the periodic tasks T1 = (1, 2, 1) and T2 = (0, 3, 1) at a
processor. The utilization at the processor is 1
2 + 13
= 56
. The periodic jobs can be
executed as follows.
J2 J1 J2 J1
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
J1 time axis
The conflict at time 3, when periodic jobs of both T1 and T2 are released, must be
resolved by some scheduler. In this example, T1 is given priority over T2. Different
schedulers will be discussed in section 19.2.
19.2 Schedulers
An offline scheduler determines the order in which jobs will be executed beforehand,
typically with an algorithm for an NP-complete graph problem. In such schedulers,
19.2 Schedulers 183
time is usually divided into regular time intervals called frames, and in each frame,
a predetermined set of periodic tasks is executed. Jobs may be sliced into subjobs to
accommodate frame length. Offline scheduling is conceptually relatively simple, but
cannot cope so well with jitter (that is, imprecise release and execution times), extra
workload, nondeterminism, and system modifications.
Here we focus on online schedulers, where the schedule is computed at run-time.
Scheduling decisions are taken when jobs are released, when aperiodic/sporadic
tasks arrive, when jobs are completed, or when resources are required or released.
Released jobs are placed in priority queues, ordered by for instance release time,
execution time, period of the task, deadline, or slack. The latter means the available
idle time of a job until the next deadline. For example, if at time 2 a job with a
deadline at time 6 still needs three time units to complete, then its slack at time 2 is
(6 − 2) − 3 = 1.
For simplicity, we consider aperiodic and sporadic jobs instead of tasks. Such
jobs are offered to processors at run-time. Sporadic jobs are only accepted at a processor
if they can be completed in time, without causing the processor to miss hard
deadlines of other jobs. We assume that aperiodic jobs are always accepted and are
performed such that periodic and accepted sporadic jobs do not miss their deadlines.
Sporadic and aperiodic jobs that need to be executed at a processor are placed in job
queues. The queueing discipline of aperiodic jobs tries to minimize the penalty associated
to missed soft deadlines (for example, minimize the number of missed soft
deadlines, or the average tardiness, being the amount of time by which an aperiodic
job misses its deadline).
Unless stated otherwise, we assume that there is no resource competition and
that jobs are preemptive, meaning that they can be suspended at any time in their
execution.
Scheduling periodic jobs
A popular scheduler for periodic tasks is the rate-monotonic scheduler, which gives
periodic jobs with a shorter period a higher priority. A strong point of this scheduler
is that the static priority at the level of tasks makes its schedules relatively easy
to compute and predict. The idea behind the rate-monotonic scheduler is that if a
periodic job J1 has a shorter period than a periodic job J2, then the relative deadline
of J1 is shorter than the relative deadline of J2. However, it may be the case that J2
has been released before J1, in which case Js has an earlier deadline than J1. As
a result, the rate-monotonic scheduler is not optimal, in the sense that it may cause
periodic jobs to miss their deadline, even in cases where the utilization of the periodic
tasks at a processor is less than one.
Example 19.2 Consider a single processor, with periodic tasks T1 = (0, 4, 2) and
T2 = (0, 6, 3). Note that utilization is 2
4 + 36
= 1. The rate-monotonic scheduler,
which gives jobs from T1 a higher priority than jobs from T2, schedules the periodic
jobs as follows.
184 19 Online Scheduling
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
J1 J2 J1 J2 J2 J1 J2
Note that T2 is preempted by T1 at times 4 and 8. The first periodic job of T2 misses
its deadline at time 6.
The earliest deadline first scheduler gives a job a higher priority if its deadline is
earlier. In case of preemptive jobs and no competition for resources, this scheduler
is optimal, in the sense that if utilization at a processor does not exceed one, then
periodic jobs will be scheduled in such a way that no deadlines are missed.
Example 19.3 Consider the setting of example 19.2: a single processor, with periodic
tasks T1 = (0, 4, 2) and T2 = (0, 6, 3). The earliest deadline first scheduler may
schedule the periodic jobs as follows.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
J1 J2 J1 J2 J1
No deadlines are missed. Note that at time 8 it would also be possible to let J1
preempt J2, because both jobs have their deadline at time 12.
The least slack-time first scheduler gives a job a higher priority if it has less slack.
This scheduler is also optimal: if utilization at a processor does not exceed one, then
periodic jobs will be scheduled in such a way that no deadlines are missed.
Slack of a job gives precise information how much time can be spent on other
jobs without this job missing its deadline. However, it is computationally expensive.
Another drawback of the least slack-time first scheduler is that priority between jobs
is dynamic, in the sense that it may change over time. Continuous scheduling decisions
would lead to so-called context switch overhead in case of two jobs with the
same amount of slack, because they would interrupt each other repeatedly.
In case of nonpreemptive jobs, or resource competition, it may be impossible
to schedule periodic jobs in such a way that no deadlines are missed, even in cases
where utilization at a processor is (much smaller than) one. For instance, suppose
there are two nonpreemptive periodic tasks (0, 1, e) and (0, p, 2). No matter how
small e > 0 and how large p are chosen, as soon as a job of the second periodic task
is executed, a job of the first periodic task will miss its deadline. The same holds
if these periodic tasks are preemptive, but they both require the same resource from
start to finish. Moreover, nonpreemptive jobs or resource competition can give rise
to so-called scheduling anomalies: shorter execution times may lead to violation of
deadlines. This is shown in the next example.
Example 19.4 Let three nonpreemptive jobs be executed at the same processor: job
J1 is released at time 0 with a deadline at time 2 and execution time 1; job J2 is
released at time 1 with a deadline at time 5 and execution time 2; and job J3 is
19.2 Schedulers 185
released at time 2 with a deadline at time 3 and execution time 1. The earliest deadline
first and least slack-time first schedulers both schedule these three jobs as follows.
0 1 2 3
J1 J2 J3
4
Job J3 misses its deadline at time 3.
If the execution time of J1 is increased from 1 to 2, then the earliest deadline first
and least slack-time first schedulers both schedule these three jobs as follows.
0 1 2 3 4 5
J1 J3 J2
In this case no deadlines are missed.
Scheduling aperiodic jobs
We assume that aperiodic jobs are always accepted for execution at a processor and
that they are executed in such a way that periodic and accepted sporadic jobs do not
miss their hard deadlines. The challenge is to execute aperiodic jobs in such a way
that they adhere to their soft deadlines as much as possible.
A straightforward solution is the background server, which schedules aperiodic
jobs only in idle time, when no periodic and sporadic jobs are available for execution.
The drawback is that this server may needlessly let an aperiodic job miss its deadline.
Example 19.5 Let aperiodic job A have execution time 1 and a deadline one time
unit away, while sporadic job S has execution time 1 and a deadline ten time units
away. Although A could easily be scheduled before S, the background server would
schedule S first, causing A to miss its deadline.
In the slack stealing server, an aperiodic job may be executed as long as the
processor has slack, meaning that it could idle without causing periodic or sporadic
jobs to miss their deadline. The drawback of this server is that the amount of slack
of a processor is difficult to compute, because it changes over time, and in practice
one would have to take jitter into account.
Example 19.6 Suppose that a processor is executing periodic tasks T1 = (0, 2, 12
)
and T2 = (0, 3, 12
), and that aperiodic jobs are available for execution at this processor
in the time interval [0, 6]. The following graph depicts how, with the slack
stealing server, the amount of slack of the processor changes over time.

In the time intervals ⟨0, 112
⟩, ⟨2, 212
⟩, ⟨3, 312
⟩, and ⟨4, 5⟩, aperiodic jobs are executed.
A periodic job from T1 is executed in ⟨112
, 2⟩, ⟨312
, 4⟩, and ⟨5, 512
⟩ and a periodic job
from T2 in ⟨212
, 3⟩ and ⟨512
, 6⟩.
We discuss three more servers, which are based on utilization. Suppose that periodic
tasks Tk = (rk, pk, ek) for k = 1, . . . , n are being executed at the processor
under consideration. For simplicity, we ignore sporadic jobs.
The polling server carries two parameters ps and es: in each period of length ps,
the first es time units can be used to execute aperiodic jobs. The polling server works
correctly if
!n
k=1
ek
pk
+
es
ps ≤ 1. (19.1)
For the correctness of the polling server it is essential that in a period ps, aperiodic
jobs are executed only in the first es time units; see example 19.7. A drawback of
the polling server is that aperiodic jobs released just after the first es time units of a
period ps may be delayed needlessly.
The deferrable server is similar to the polling server, but allows aperiodic jobs
to be executed for es time units in the entire period ps, so not only at the start. The
following example shows that for the deferrable server, criterion (19.1) for the values
ps and es would be incorrect.
Example 19.7 Consider a processor with one periodic task T = (2, 5, 31
3 ), and let
ps = 3 and es = 1. Note that criterion (19.1) is satisfied.
Let an aperiodic job A with execution time 2 arrive at time 2. The deferrable
server would allow A to execute at the end of the first period ps, from time 2 until
time 3, and at the start of the second period ps from time 3 until time 4. As a result,
the first periodic job, which is released at time 2, can start execution only at time 4,
until time 71
3 . So it misses its deadline at time 7.
A drawback of the deferrable server is that it is not easy to determine optimal
values for ps and es.
The total bandwidth server fixes a utilization rate ˜us for aperiodic jobs, such that
!n
k=1
ek
pk
+ ˜us ≤ 1.
19.2 Schedulers 187
When the queue of aperiodic jobs gets a new head, a deadline d is determined for
this head as follows. If, at a time t, either a job arrives at the empty aperiodic queue,
or an aperiodic job completes and the tail of the aperiodic queue is nonempty, then
d ← max{d, t} +
e
˜us
where e denotes the execution time of the new head of the aperiodic queue. Initially,
d = 0.
Aperiodic jobs can now be treated in the same way as periodic jobs, by the earliest
deadline first scheduler. Periodic jobs are guaranteed to meet their deadlines (in
the absence of sporadic jobs), and aperiodic jobs meet the deadlines assigned to them
(which may differ from their actual soft deadlines).
Example 19.8 Consider a processor with two periodic tasks T1 = (0, 2, 1) and T2 =
(0, 3, 1). We fix ˜us = 16
.

– Aperiodic job A1, released at time 1 with execution time 12
, gets (at 1) deadline
1 + 3 = 4.
– Aperiodic job A2, released at time 2 with execution time 23
, gets (at 212
) deadline
4 + 4 = 8.
– Aperiodic job A3, released at time 3 with execution time 23
, gets (at 616
) deadline
8 + 4 = 12.
Scheduling sporadic jobs
We now present an acceptance test for sporadic jobs. A sporadic job can be accepted
at a processor only if it can be executed before its (hard) deadline, without causing
the violation of deadlines of periodic and accepted sporadic jobs at this processor.
A sporadic job with deadline d and execution time e that is offered to a processor
at time t, is accepted if utilization of the periodic and accepted sporadic jobs in the
time interval [t, d] is never more than 1 − e
d−t . If accepted, utilization in [t, d] is
increased with e
d−t . Periodic and accepted sporadic jobs can be scheduled according
to the earliest deadline first scheduler.
Example 19.9 Consider a processor with one periodic task T = (0, 2, 1). Utilization
of this periodic task over the entire time domain is 1
2 .
– Sporadic job S1 with execution time 2 and a deadline 6 is offered to the processor
at time 1. S1 is accepted, and utilization in [1, 6] is increased to 1
2 + 25
= 9
10 .
– Sporadic job S2 with execution time 2 and a deadline 20 is offered to the processor
at time 2. S2 is rejected, because utilization in the time interval [2, 6] would
increase beyond 1.
188 19 Online Scheduling
– Sporadic job S3 with execution time 1 and a deadline 13 is offered to the processor
at time 3. S3 is accepted, and utilization in [3, 6] is increased to 9
10 + 1
10 = 1,
and utilization in [6, 13] is increased to 12
+ 1
10 = 35

The acceptance test may reject schedulable sporadic jobs. In particular, sporadic
job S2 in the previous example is schedulable, but it is nevertheless rejected.
The total bandwidth server can be integrated with the acceptance test for sporadic
jobs, for example, by making the allowed utilization rate ˜us for the total bandwidth
server dynamic.
19.3 Resource access control
So far we have ignored competition for resources, such as a block of memory. In this
section we consider resource units that can be requested by jobs during their execution,
and are allocated to jobs in a mutually exclusive fashion. When a requested
resource is refused, the job is preempted.
One danger of resource sharing is that it may give rise to deadlock, when two
jobs block each other because they hold a different resource, and these jobs require
both resources. A second danger is that a high-priority job J may be blocked by a
sequence of low-priority jobs, when J requires a resource that is being held by a job
with a very low priority. We give examples of these two situations.
Example 19.10 Consider two jobs J1 and J2, where J1 has a higher priority than
J2, and two resources R and R′.
First, J2 is executing, and claims R. Then J1 arrives at the same processor, preempts
J2, starts executing, and claims R′. Next, J1 requires R; since this resource
is held by J2, J1 is preempted and J2 continues its execution. Next, J2 requires R′;
since this resource is held by J1, J2 is preempted. Now J1 is blocked because J2
holds R, while J2 is blocked because J1 holds R′. So J1 and J2 are deadlocked.
Example 19.11 Consider jobs J0, J1, . . . , Jk, with as priorities J0 > J1 > · · · >
Jk. There is a resource R, which will be required by both J0 and Jk.
First, Jk is executing, and claims R. Then Jk−1 arrives at the same processor,
preempts Jk, and starts executing. Next, Jk−2 arrives at the same processor, preempts
Jk−1, and starts executing. This pattern is repeated, until finally J0 arrives at the
same processor, preempts J1, and starts executing. Next, J0 requires R; since this
19.3 Resource access control 189
resource is held by Jk, J0 is preempted, and J1 (which has the highest priority of
the available jobs) continues its execution. When J1 is completed, J2 continues its
execution; upon completion of J2, J3 continues its execution, and so on, until finally
Jk continues its execution, completes, and releases R. Only then J0 can claim R and
continue its execution.
Jk Jk−1 J1 J0 J1 Jk−1 Jk J0
Priority inheritance makes blocking of a high-priority job J by a sequence of
low-priority jobs less likely. The idea is that when a job J1 is blocked because it
requires a resource that is held by a job J2, and J1 has a higher priority than J2, then
J2 inherits the priority of J1 as long as it is blocking the execution of J1.
Example 19.12 We revisit example 19.11, with priority inheritance. When J0 requires
R, Jk inherits the priority of Jk. So instead of J1, now Jk continues its execution.
When Jk completes and releases R, J0 can claim R and continue its execution.
Jk Jk−1 J1 J0 Jk J0 J1 Jk−1
However, with priority inheritance a deadlock can still occur. For instance, priority
inheritance has no effect on the execution discussed in example 19.10. Such
deadlocks can be avoided by priority ceiling. The priority ceiling of a resource R
at a time t is the highest priority of (known) jobs that will require R at some time
≥ t. The priority ceiling of a processor at a time t is the highest priority ceiling of
resources that are in use at time t. The priority ceiling of a processor has a special
bottom value Ω when no resources are in use. In case of priority ceiling, from the
arrival of a job at a processor, this job is not released until its priority is higher than
the priority ceiling of the processor.
The idea behind priority ceiling is that a job J is released only if all the resources
it will require during its execution are not in use. Because otherwise at the arrival
of J the priority ceiling of the processor increases to the priority of J, if this priority
ceiling is not at or beyond this level already. Of course, this approach works
properly only if all the resources a job will require during its execution are always
known beforehand. If priorities of jobs do not change over time (as is the case for the
earliest deadline first scheduler, but not for the least slack-time first scheduler), then
deadlocks like the one in example 19.10 cannot occur.
Example 19.13 We revisit example 19.10, with priority ceiling. When J1 arrives at
the processor, the priority ceiling is increased to the priority of J1, because J1 will
require R, and this resource is in use by J2. So J1 is not yet released. When J2
completes and releases R, the priority ceiling goes down to Ω, so that J1 is released
and starts executing.
With priority ceiling, blocking of a high-priority job by a sequence of lowerpriority
jobs becomes less likely.
190 19 Online Scheduling
Example 19.14 We revisit example 19.11, with priority ceiling, under the assumption
that the future arrival of J0 is known from the start. Since J0 will require R, and
Jk holds R, the priority ceiling becomes the priority of J0. Therefore, Jk−1 is not released
at its arrival, and Jk continues its execution. When Jk completes and releases
R, the priority ceiling drops to Ω, so that jobs are released. When J0 arrives, it can
claim R, and start executing straightaway.
Jk Jk−2 J1 J0 J1 Jk−2 Jk−1
Priority ceiling has no effect on jobs that have been released. For instance, if in
example 19.11 the arrival of J0 is known only at its arrival, priority ceiling does not
help. Therefore, priority inheritance tends to be imposed on top of priority ceiling.
Priority ceiling can be extended to a setting with multiple units of the same resource
type. Then the definition of priority ceiling needs to be adapted as follows.
The priority ceiling of a resource R with k free units at a time t is the highest priority
level of known jobs that require more than k units of R at some time ≥ t.
Bibliographical notes
The slack stealing server originates from [48], the deferrable server from [74], and
the total bandwidth server in [73]. Priority inheritance was introduced in [71], and
priority ceiling in [65].
Exercises
In these exercises, all jobs are assumed to be preemptive.
Exercise 19.1 [50] Consider a system with two processors. Suppose jobs J1, J2, and
J3 are released at time 0, with execution times 1, 1, and 2, and deadlines at times 1,
2, and 3, respectively.

Pseudocode Descriptions
Pseudocode descriptions are presented for a considerable number of distributed algorithms
discussed in the main body of this book. Several algorithms are excluded
here, either because their pseudocode description is trivial or very similar to another
algorithm that is included, or because the main body contains a description that resembles
the pseudocode.
Each piece of pseudocode is presented for a process p or pi; its local variables
are subscripted with p or i, respectively. We use Neighborsp to denote the set of
neighbors of process p in the network, and Processes for the set of processes in the
network.
Each pseudocode description starts with a variable declaration section. Let bool,
nat, int, and real denote the data type of Booleans, natural numbers, integers, and
reals, with as default initial value false and 0 (for the latter three). The operations
∧, ∨, and ¬ on Booleans denote conjunction, disjunction, and negation, respectively.
The data type dist, representing distance, consists of the natural numbers extended
with infinity ∞, where ∞+ d = d +∞ = ∞ for all distance values d, and d < ∞ for all d ̸= ∞; its default initial value is∞.
The data type of processes in the network, proc, has as default initial value ⊥ (i.e., undefined). The data types mess-queue and proc-queue represent FIFO queues
of basic messages and processes, respectively. Likewise, mess-set, proc-set, procnat-
set, proc-real-nat-set, and proc-dist-set represent sets of basic messages, processes,
pairs of a process and a natural number, triples of a process, a natural number,
and a real value, and pairs of a process and a distance value, respectively. Variables
containing queues or sets have as default initial value ∅, that is, empty. There are
three operations on queues: head produces the head and tail the tail of the queue
(on the empty queue these operations are undefined), while append(Q, e) appends
element e at the end of queue Q.
We recall that assignment of a new value to a variable is written as ←. Equality
between two data elements, d1 = d2 (or between two sets, S1 = S2), represents a
Boolean value, which is true if and only if the two elements (or sets) are equal. We
also recall that the network topology is supposed to be strongly connected. In the
pseudocode it is assumed that the network size N is greater than one.
194 Pseudocode Descriptions
A process is supposed to interrupt the execution of a procedure call (under a
boxed text, such as “If p receives [...]”) only if it has to wait for an incoming message,
or in case of a while b do statement end while construct after performing statement
if the Boolean b is true, or when it enters its critical section.
In general, pseudocode tends to be error-prone, because on one hand it is condensed
and intricate, while on the other hand it has never been executed. I welcome
any comments on the pseudocode descriptions, as well as on the main body of the
book.
Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm
The Boolean variable recordedp in the following pseudocode is set (to true) when
p takes a local snapshot of its state. For each incoming channel c of p, the Boolean
variable markerp[c] is set when a marker message arrives at p through c, and the
queue statep[c] keeps track of the basic messages that arrive through channel c after
p has taken its local snapshot and before a marker message arrives through c.

track of the basic messages that arrive at p through its incoming channel qp after p
Lai-Yang snapshot algorithm 195
has taken its local snapshot and that were sent by q before it took its local snapshot.
The variable counterq[qp] counts how many basic messages process q has sent into
its outgoing channel qp before taking its local snapshot. Right before taking its local
snapshot, q sends the control message ⟨presnap, counterq[qp] + 1⟩ to p (the +1
is present because the control message itself is also counted), and p stores the value
within this message in the variable counterp[qp]. Finally, p terminates when it has
received a control message ⟨presnap, k⟩ and k − 1 basic messages with the tag
false through each incoming channel qp.
bool recordedp;

added one extra unit of weight to the system, and waits for an acknowledgment from

the token, tokenp is set. When p sends/receives a basic message, mess-counterp is
increased/decreased by one. The variable token-counterp is used to store the counter

parentp[q] is the parent of p in the spanning tree rooted at process q, and distp[q]
the distance value of p toward destination q. In roundp, p keeps track of its round
number. The distance values of the pivot in round k are stored in Distancesp[k]. Each
process that sends a request to p for the distance values of the pivot in the current or
a future round k is stored in Forwardp[k]. We assume that p only treats incoming
requests when it is idle, to avoid that a request could be stored in Forwardp[k] after p
forwarded the distance values of the pivot in round k. The pivot in round k is denoted
by pivot(k). We include the optimization that a process, at the reception of distance
values from the pivot, first checks which of its distance values are improved, and
then forwards only those elements of the set that gave rise to an improved distance
value.

Frederickson’s breadth-first search algorithm
parentp is the parent of p in the spanning tree rooted at the initiator, and distp the
distance value of p toward the initiator. In distp[r], p stores the best-known distance
value of neighbor r. After p has sent forward or explore messages, it keeps
track in Ackp of the neighbors that should still send a (positive or negative) reply. In
Frederickson’s breadth-first search algorithm 205
Reportedp, p remembers to which neighbors it should send a forward message in
the next round. The initiator maintains the round number in counter. Each round, ℓ
levels are explored. For uniformity, messages ⟨reverse, b⟩ are always supplied with
the distance value of the sender.

activep is set when p is an initiator, and reset when p becomes passive. If p terminates
as the leader, it sets leaderp. Since messages of two consecutive rounds can overtake
each other, p keeps track of the parity of its round number in parityp, and attaches
this Boolean value to its message. In election-id p, p stores the ID it assumes for the
current election round. In neighb-id p[0, b] and neighb-id p[1, b], p stores the process
IDs of its two nearest active predecessors in the directed ring, with b the parity of the
corresponding election round. We assume a total order < on process IDs.

Gallager-Humblet-Spira minimum spanning tree algorithm
parentp is p’s parent toward the core edge of p’s fragment. The name and level of
p’s fragment are stored in namep and level p. Initially, statep has the value find;
for simplicity, the state sleep and the corresponding wake-up phase are omitted.
The channel states, statep[q] for each q ∈ Neighborsp, initially are basic. While
looking for a least-weight outgoing edge, p stores the optimal intermediate result in
best -weightp. If the optimal result was reported through the basic or branch edge pq,
then best -edgep has the value q. While p is testing whether basic edge pq is outgoing,
test-edgep has the value q. In counterp, p keeps track of how many branch edges
have reported their minimal value; it starts at 1 to account for the fact that p’s parent
in general does not report a value (except for the core nodes). In parent -reportp,
a core node p can keep the value reported by its parent; if there is no report yet its
value is 0, while the value∞means that p’s parent has reported there are no outgoing
edges at its side. In Connectsp and Testsp, p stores incoming connect and test
messages to which a reply is delayed until the level of p’s fragment is high enough.

Ricart-Agrawala mutual exclusion algorithm
We use the lexicographical order on pairs (t, i) with t a time stamp and i a process
index. clocki represents the clock value at pi; it starts at 1. In req-stampi, pi stores
the time stamp of its current request; if there is none, req-stampi = 0. The number
of permissions that pi has received for its current request is maintained in counteri.
In Pendingi, pi remembers from which processes it has received a request but to
Raymond’s mutual exclusion algorithm 213
which it has not yet sent permission. The Carvalho-Roucairol optimization is taken
into account. In Requestsi, pi stores to which processes it must send (or has sent) its
next (or current) request.

Agrawal-El Abbadi mutual exclusion algorithm 215
Agrawal-El Abbadi mutual exclusion algorithm
requestsp is a queue of processes from which p must still obtain permission to enter
its critical section. The set Permissionsp contains the processes from which p
has received permission during its current attempt to become privileged. The queue
pendingp contains the processes from which p has received a request; it has only sent
permission to the head of this queue. (We recall that p may have to ask permission
from itself.) We assume that N = 2k − 1 for some k > 1, so that the binary tree
has depth k − 1. root denotes the root node of the binary tree, and for any nonleaf
q in the tree, left -child (q) and right-child (q) denote its child at the left and right,
respectively. Processes may crash, and are provided with a complete and strongly
accurate failure detector. When p detects that another process has crashed, it puts the
corresponding process ID in the set Crashedp.

MCS queue lock
Since processes can use the same node for each lock access, we take the liberty
to represent the queue of waiting processes using process IDs instead of nodes.
The multi-writer register waitp is true as long as p must wait to get the lock. The
multi-writer register succp points to the successor of p in the queue of waiting processes.
The single-writer register predp points to the predecessor of p in the queue
of waiting processes. When a process arrives at this queue, it assigns its process
ID to the multi-writer register last . The operation last .get-and-set(p) assigns the
value p to last , and returns the previous value of last , all in one atomic step. And
last .compare-and-set(p,⊥) in one atomic operation reads the value of last , and
CLH queue lock with timeouts 217
either assigns the value ⊥ to last , if its current value is p, or leaves the value of last
unchanged otherwise. In the first case this operation returns true, while in the second
case it returns false.

If p wants to enter its critical section

CLH queue lock with timeouts
The data type pointer consists of pointers to a node, with as default initial value
null. If p want to enter its critical section, it creates a node ν containing a pointer
predν. Let node ν′ denote the nearest nonabandoned predecessor of ν in the queue.
predp points to ν′. In pred-predp, p repeatedly stores the value of predν′ . If p decides
to abandon its attempt to get the lock, and it has a successor in the queue, then it lets
predν point to ν′. The multi-writer register last points to the last node in the queue.

Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm
Self-stabilizing algorithms are always defined in a shared-memory framework. Therefore,
the message-passing description of the Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm
in section 18.3 is here cast in shared variables. We recall that variables can be
initialized with any value in their domain.
rootp is the root of the spanning tree according to p, parentp represents the
parent of p in the spanning tree, and distp is the distance value of p toward the
root. The variables reqp, fromp, top, and directionp deal with join requests and
corresponding grant messages. In reqp the process ID of the process that originally
issued the request is stored, in fromp the neighbor from which p received the request,
in top the neighbor to which p forwarded the request, and in directionp whether a
request is being forwarded to the root of the fragment, or a grant message is being
forwarded to the process that originally issued the request. togglep makes sure that p
performs an event only when all its neighbors have copied the current values of p’s
local variables; toggleq(p) represents the copy at neighbor q of the value of togglep.
It is assumed that a process copies the values of all local variables of a neighbor in
one atomic step.
We use the following abbreviations. AmRootp states that p considers itself root:
parentp =⊥ ∧ rootp = p ∧ distp = 0.
NotRootp states that p does not consider itself root, and that the values of p’s local
variables are in line with those of its parent:
parentp ∈ Neighborsp ∧ rootp > p
∧ rootp = rootparentp ∧ distp = distparentp + 1.
Afek-Kutten-Yung spanning tree algorithm 219
MaxRootp states that no neighbor of p has a root value greater than rootp:
rootp ≥ root r for all r ∈ Neighborsp.
The network is stable, with the process with the largest ID as root, if at each process
p either AmRootp or NotRootp holds, as well as MaxRootp.
In the following pseudocode, p repeatedly copies the values of the local variables
of its neighbors, checks whether all its neighbors have copied the current values of
p’s local variables, and if so, tries to perform one of several possible events. First
of all, if NotRootp ∧ MaxRootp does not hold and p does not yet consider itself
root, then p makes itself root. The second kind of events arises if MaxRootp does
not hold (and so, since p skipped the first case, AmRootp does hold). Then either p
asks a neighbor with a maximal root value to become its parent, if p is not already
making such a request to a neighbor q, expressed by (the negation of) the predicate
Askingp(q):
root q ≥ root r for all r ∈ Neighborsp
∧ reqp = fromp = p ∧ top = q ∧ directionp = ask.
Or such a request by p may be granted by a neighbor q, expressed by the predicate
Grantedp(q):
reqq = reqp ∧ fromq = fromp ∧ directionq = grant ∧ directionp = ask,
where we take q to be top. It is moreover required that p issued a request to top,
expressed by the predicate Requestor p:
top ∈ Neighborsp ∧ root top > p ∧ reqp = fromp = p.
In this case top becomes p’s parent. The third kind of events arises when p is not yet
handling a request from a neighbor q, expressed by (the negation of) the predicate
Handlingp(q):
reqq = reqp ∧ fromp = q ∧ toq = p ∧ top = parentp ∧ directionq = ask.
Here q should be either a root that issued a join request, or a child of p in the spanning
tree, expressed by the predicate Requestp(q):
(AmRoot q ∧ reqq = fromq = q) ∨ (parent q = p ∧ reqq /∈ {q,⊥}).
If the four variables that capture requests are not all undefined, expressed by (the
negation of) the predicate NotHandlingp,
reqp =⊥ ∧ fromp =⊥ ∧ top =⊥ ∧ directionp =⊥,
then p sets the values of these four variables to ⊥. Otherwise, p forwards a request,
but only if fromparentp ̸= p (allowing parentp to first reset its join request variables).
The fourth kind of event is that a root p that is handling a request of a neighbor sets
220 Pseudocode Descriptions
directionp to grant. Finally, the fifth kind of event is that a nonroot p that finds that
its request has been granted by its parent sets directionp to grant. Note that for the
third, fourth, and fifth kinds of events, AmRootp ∨NotRootp (because p skipped the
first case) and MaxRootp (because p skipped the second case). And for the fourth
and fifth kinds of events, Requestp(q) ∧ Handlingp(q) for some q ∈ Neighborsp
(because p skipped the third case).
